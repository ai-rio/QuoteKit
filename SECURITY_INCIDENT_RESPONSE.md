# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE - SECRET EXPOSURE

**Date**: August 11, 2025  
**Incident**: GitGuardian detected 9 secret incidents in commit 4f08ccd  
**Severity**: HIGH - Production secrets potentially exposed  
**Status**: ACTIVE REMEDIATION IN PROGRESS

## üî• IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. **ROTATE ALL EXPOSED SECRETS IMMEDIATELY**

#### Supabase Secrets ‚ö° CRITICAL
- [ ] **Supabase Service Role Key**: Regenerate in Supabase Dashboard
  - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/settings/api
  - Click "Reset" on Service Role Key
  - Update production environment variables
  
- [ ] **Database Password**: Change in Supabase Dashboard
  - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/settings/database
  - Reset database password
  - Update all connection strings

#### Stripe Secrets ‚ö° CRITICAL  
- [ ] **Stripe Secret Key**: Regenerate in Stripe Dashboard
  - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
  - Roll the secret key immediately
  - Update production environment variables
  
- [ ] **Webhook Secret**: Regenerate webhook endpoint
  - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
  - Create new webhook endpoint
  - Update webhook secret in production

#### Email Service ‚ö° MEDIUM
- [ ] **Resend API Key**: Regenerate in Resend Dashboard
  - Go to: https://resend.com/api-keys
  - Delete current key and create new one
  - Update production environment variables

### 2. **SECURE REPOSITORY**

#### Git History Cleanup
- [ ] **DO NOT** attempt to remove secrets from Git history (makes it worse)
- [ ] Accept that secrets were exposed and focus on rotation
- [ ] Document incident for security audit

#### Prevent Future Exposures
- [ ] Add `.gitleaksignore` file (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` to exclude all `.env*` files
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks with Gitleaks
- [ ] Implement secret scanning in CI/CD

### 3. **MONITORING & DETECTION**

#### Immediate Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor Supabase logs for unusual activity
- [ ] Monitor Stripe dashboard for unauthorized transactions
- [ ] Check email service logs for abuse
- [ ] Review application logs for suspicious access

#### Set Up Alerts
- [ ] Enable Supabase security alerts
- [ ] Enable Stripe fraud detection
- [ ] Set up log monitoring alerts
- [ ] Configure GitGuardian for ongoing monitoring

## üõ°Ô∏è LONG-TERM SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

### Secret Management
- [ ] Implement proper secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- [ ] Use environment-specific secret rotation
- [ ] Implement least-privilege access principles
- [ ] Set up secret expiration policies

### Development Practices
- [ ] Mandatory security training for all developers
- [ ] Implement security code review process
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Create security incident response playbook

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Enable audit logging on all services
- [ ] Implement network security controls
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection
- [ ] Regular security assessments
