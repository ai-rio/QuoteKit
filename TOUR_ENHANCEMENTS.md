# Quote Creation Tour Enhancements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tour Modal Positioning Issue ✅
**Problem**: Tour modal wasn't smoothly following the overlay section focus
**Solution**: 
- Implemented enhanced positioning system with smooth transitions

- Applied `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` transitions for smooth movement
- Added viewport boundary detection to keep popovers visible
- Implemented transform-based positioning adjustments

### 2. Done Button Not Working ✅
**Problem**: Done button at the end of tour wasn't functioning properly
**Solution**:

- Fixed button text transformation (Close → Done) for final step
- Added celebration animations and styling for tour completion
