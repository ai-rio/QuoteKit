# Simple Test Post

This is a very basic test post to see if MDX rendering works without any custom components.

## Basic Formatting

Here's some **bold text** and *italic text*.

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Code

Here's some `inline code` and a code block:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

## Conclusion

If this renders without errors, then the basic MDX system is working and the issue is with custom components.
