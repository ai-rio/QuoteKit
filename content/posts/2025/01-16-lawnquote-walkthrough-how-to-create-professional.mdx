Before creating quotes, let's establish your professional foundation. A complete business profile ensures every quote looks polished and builds client trust.

### Step 1: Access Settings

1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar (gear icon)
2. You'll see your business profile form with several sections

### Step 2: Essential Company Information

**Company Details:**
- **Business Name**: Exactly as it appears on your business license
- **Address**: Complete street address (appears on quotes for local credibility)
- **Phone Number**: Primary business line (not personal cell)
- **Email**: Professional email address (yourname@yourbusiness.com)
- **Website**: If you have one (builds additional credibility)

**Business Registration:**
- **License Number**: If required in your area
- **Insurance Information**: Liability insurance details
- **Certifications**: Any relevant landscaping certifications

### Step 3: Financial Defaults

These settings save you time on every single quote:

**Tax Settings:**
- **Default Tax Rate**: Your local sales tax percentage
- **Tax-Exempt Services**: Check services that don't require tax in your area
- **Multiple Tax Rates**: Set different rates for materials vs. services if applicable

**Markup and Pricing:**
- **Default Markup**: Standard profit margin (typically 15-25% for landscaping)
- **Labor Rate**: Your standard hourly rate for different service types
- **Equipment Charges**: Default rates for equipment usage

**Payment Terms:**
- **Payment Schedule**: Net 30, due on completion, etc.
- **Late Fees**: If you charge them
- **Accepted Payment Methods**: Cash, check, credit card, financing

<Callout type="success" title="Pro Tip">

</Callout>

### Step 4: Professional Presentation

**Quote Customization:**
- **Header Message**: Brief company description or value proposition
- **Footer Information**: Warranty details, contact info, social media
- **Terms and Conditions**: Standard project terms (very important!)
- **Quote Validity**: How long quotes remain valid (typically 30 days)

### Why This Setup Matters

Professional quotes start with professional business information. When clients see:
- Complete contact information
- Professional email addresses  
- Clear payment terms
- Proper licensing information

They immediately trust you more than competitors who send informal estimates. This foundation work pays dividends on every quote you send.
