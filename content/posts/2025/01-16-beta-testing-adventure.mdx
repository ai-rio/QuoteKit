# Complete QuoteKit Testing Guide

Thank you for helping us test QuoteKit! Your feedback is essential for building software that actually works for landscaping professionals. This guide walks you through testing every feature so we can identify what works well and what needs improvement.

## How This Guide Works

This guide is organized by the main areas of QuoteKit. For each section, you'll find:
- **What to test** - Specific features and functions
- **How to test it** - Step-by-step instructions
- **What to look for** - Things that might go wrong or could be better
- **Real scenarios** - Practical situations you might encounter

After testing each section, you'll be asked to fill out a feedback form with your experience.

## Getting Started: Your Account Setup

Before testing features, let's make sure your account is properly set up.

### Step 1: Account Creation and Login
1. Sign up for your free QuoteKit account
2. Check your email for verification
3. Log in and complete your profile
4. Note: You get 5 free quotes per month to test with

### Step 2: Understanding Your Dashboard
When you first log in, you'll see your dashboard. This is your home base. Look for:
- **Total Quotes**: Shows how many quotes you've created
- **Usage tracking**: Shows how many of your 5 monthly quotes you've used
- **Quick Actions**: Buttons to create quotes, manage clients, etc.
- **Recent Activity**: Your latest quotes and their status

**What to test**: Click around the dashboard. Do all the numbers make sense? Are the buttons easy to find?

## Testing Core Features: Creating Your First Quote

This is the heart of QuoteKit - let's make sure it works perfectly.

### Basic Quote Creation
1. Click "Create New Quote" from your dashboard
2. Fill in client information (you can use fake names for testing)
3. Add line items for services (like "Lawn Mowing" or "Tree Trimming")
4. Set quantities and prices
5. Review the total calculation
6. Save the quote

**What to look for**:
- Does the math add up correctly?
- Are the forms easy to understand?
- Can you save and find your quote later?
- Does anything feel confusing or slow?

### Testing Different Quote Scenarios

Try creating quotes for these common landscaping jobs:

**Scenario 1: Simple Lawn Care**
- Weekly lawn mowing for 3 months
- Include travel time/fuel costs
- Add seasonal cleanup services
- Test: Does the recurring service calculation work?

**Scenario 2: Hardscaping Project**
- Patio installation (500 sq ft)
- Materials: pavers, sand, gravel
- Labor: excavation, installation, cleanup
- Test: Can you handle complex multi-part projects?

**Scenario 3: Emergency/Rush Job**
- Tree removal after storm damage
- Same-day service premium
- Equipment rental costs
- Test: How quickly can you create an urgent quote?

### Quote Management
After creating quotes, test these features:
1. **Finding quotes**: Can you easily locate quotes you created?
2. **Editing quotes**: Try changing prices or adding items
3. **Quote status**: Mark quotes as sent, accepted, or rejected
4. **Copying quotes**: Create similar quotes for repeat customers

**What to test**: Does everything save properly? Can you find your quotes later?

## Testing Client Management

Good client management makes quoting faster and more professional.

### Adding and Managing Clients
1. Go to the "Clients" section
2. Add a new client with complete contact information
3. Try adding multiple clients with different information
4. Test searching for clients by name or company
5. Edit client information and save changes

**What to test**:
- Is the client form easy to fill out?
- Can you find clients quickly when creating quotes?
- Does client information auto-fill when selected?
- Are there any required fields that seem unnecessary?

### Client Organization Features
- **Sorting**: Try sorting clients by name, date added, or location
- **Filtering**: Look for ways to filter clients (active, inactive, etc.)
- **Client history**: Can you see past quotes for each client?

## Testing Your Item Library

The item library stores your services and materials for quick quote building.

### Setting Up Your Services
1. Go to "Items" or "Item Library"
2. Add common services like:
   - Lawn mowing (per visit or monthly)
   - Tree trimming (per tree or hourly)
   - Mulch installation (per cubic yard)
   - Equipment rental (daily/weekly rates)

### Testing Item Features
- **Categories**: Can you organize items by type (labor, materials, equipment)?
- **Pricing**: Test different pricing methods (fixed, per unit, hourly)
- **Quick add**: How fast can you add items to quotes?
- **Bulk editing**: Can you update multiple item prices at once?

**What to look for**: Does the item system match how you actually price jobs?

## Testing Company Settings

Your company settings affect how all your quotes look and calculate.

### Basic Company Information
1. Go to "Settings" or "Company Settings"
2. Fill in your business information:
   - Company name and address
   - Contact information
   - Tax rates and business license numbers
   - Logo upload (if available)

### Pricing and Calculation Settings
Test these important settings:
- **Default markup percentages**: Set standard profit margins
- **Tax calculations**: Make sure tax rates apply correctly
- **Labor rates**: Set standard hourly rates for different types of work
- **Travel/fuel charges**: Set standard rates for job site visits

**What to test**: Create a quote after changing settings. Do the changes apply correctly?

## Understanding Free vs Premium Features

As you test, you'll encounter both free and premium features. Here's what to expect:

### Free Tier Features (What You Can Test)

### Premium Features (What You'll See But Can't Fully Use)
- **Unlimited quotes**: No monthly limits
- **Advanced analytics**: Detailed business insights and trends
- **PDF exports**: Professional quote documents with your branding
- **Bulk operations**: Edit multiple quotes or items at once
- **Advanced reporting**: Track win rates, revenue trends, seasonal patterns

### Testing the Premium Preview
Even on the free tier, you should be able to:
1. **See premium features**: Look for "Premium" or "Upgrade" labels
2. **Understand the value**: What would unlimited quotes mean for your business?
3. **Preview analytics**: You might see sample data or limited analytics
4. **Test upgrade flow**: Click upgrade buttons to see pricing (don't actually upgrade unless you want to)

**What to test**: Are the premium features clearly explained? Do you understand what you'd get by upgrading?

## Testing Premium Features Safely

If you want to test premium features without using your real payment information, we provide test payment options.

### Using Test Payment Information
When testing the upgrade process or premium features, you can use these test payment details:

**Test Credit Card Information:**
- **Card Number**: 4242424242424242 (Visa)
- **CVC**: Any 3 digits (like 123)
- **Expiration Date**: Any future date (like 12/25)

### What This Allows You To Test
Using test payment information, you can safely:
1. **Complete the upgrade process**: See exactly how upgrading works
2. **Test premium features**: Access unlimited quotes, analytics, and advanced features
3. **Evaluate the full experience**: Understand what premium users actually get
4. **Test billing and account management**: See how subscription management works

### Important Notes About Test Payments
- **No real charges**: Test card numbers never result in actual charges
- **Full feature access**: You get complete access to premium features for testing
- **Temporary access**: Test subscriptions may be reset periodically
- **Safe to use**: Your real payment information is never at risk

**What to test**: Does the upgrade process feel secure and professional? Are the premium features worth the cost?

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

Once you're comfortable with the basics, try these real-world scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Seasonal Pricing Changes
**Situation**: You need to adjust prices for winter services
1. Create quotes for summer services (lawn care, landscaping)
2. Create similar quotes for winter services (snow removal, tree work)
3. Test if you can easily adjust pricing for seasonal differences
4. Look for ways to save seasonal pricing templates

### Scenario 2: Complex Multi-Service Project
**Situation**: A client wants a complete yard makeover
1. Create a quote that includes:
   - Design consultation
   - Tree removal
   - Soil preparation
   - New plantings
   - Irrigation system
   - Ongoing maintenance contract
2. Test how the system handles complex, multi-phase projects
3. Check if you can break down costs clearly for the client

### Scenario 3: Rush Job Pricing
**Situation**: Emergency tree removal needed immediately
1. Create a quote with premium pricing for urgent work
2. Add costs for weekend/after-hours service
3. Include equipment rental and disposal fees
4. Test how quickly you can generate and send the quote

### Scenario 4: Repeat Customer Efficiency
**Situation**: Regular client needs their monthly service quote
1. Find a previous quote for this client
2. Copy or duplicate it for the new month
3. Make any necessary adjustments
4. Test how much time this saves vs. creating from scratch

## Testing Mobile and Different Devices

QuoteKit should work well whether you're in the office or on a job site.

### Mobile Testing
If possible, test QuoteKit on your phone:
1. **Login**: Can you easily log in on mobile?
2. **Quote creation**: Is it practical to create quotes on your phone?
3. **Client lookup**: Can you quickly find client information?
4. **Quote viewing**: Are quotes readable on a small screen?

### Tablet Testing
Test on a tablet if available:
1. **Field use**: Could you use this while meeting with clients?
2. **Quote presentation**: Does it look professional when showing clients?
3. **Input speed**: Is it faster than phone but more portable than laptop?

**What to test**: Which device feels most natural for different tasks?

## What to Look For: Common Issues and Feedback Areas

As you test, pay attention to these areas where we especially need feedback:

### User Experience Issues
- **Confusing buttons or labels**: If you're not sure what something does
- **Slow loading**: Pages or features that take too long to load
- **Mobile problems**: Features that don't work well on phones/tablets
- **Error messages**: Unclear or unhelpful error messages
- **Navigation**: Difficulty finding features or getting lost in the interface

### Calculation and Pricing Issues
- **Math errors**: Totals that don't add up correctly
- **Tax calculations**: Incorrect tax amounts or applications
- **Rounding problems**: Prices that round to awkward amounts
- **Currency formatting**: Prices that display incorrectly

### Business Logic Problems
- **Workflow issues**: Steps that don't match how you actually work
- **Missing features**: Things you need that aren't available
- **Unnecessary complexity**: Features that are harder than they need to be
- **Integration gaps**: Places where features don't work well together

### Data and Reliability Issues
- **Lost information**: Data that disappears or doesn't save
- **Sync problems**: Information that doesn't update everywhere it should
- **Export issues**: Problems getting your data out of the system
- **Backup concerns**: Worries about data security or loss

## Providing Effective Feedback

Your feedback is most helpful when it's specific and actionable.

### Good Feedback Examples
- **Specific**: "The tax calculation on line 3 shows 8.5% but should be 8.25% for my location"
- **Context**: "When creating quotes on mobile, the 'Add Item' button is too small to tap easily"
- **Comparison**: "This takes 5 clicks but my old system only needed 2"
- **Business impact**: "I can't send quotes to clients because there's no PDF export on the free tier"

### Less Helpful Feedback
- **Too vague**: "It's confusing"
- **No context**: "This doesn't work"
- **Personal preference**: "I don't like the color blue"
- **Feature requests without explanation**: "Add more features"

### What We Want to Know
For each feature you test, consider:
1. **Does it work correctly?** (bugs, errors, calculations)
2. **Is it easy to use?** (confusing, slow, hard to find)
3. **Does it match your workflow?** (missing steps, unnecessary complexity)
4. **Would you use this in your business?** (practical value, time savings)
