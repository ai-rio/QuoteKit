# Stripe Deployment Strategy
**Safe Production Deployment with Payment Processing**

## üéØ **Recommended Staged Approach**

### **Stage 1: Production Deployment with Test Keys (RECOMMENDED FIRST)**

Deploy to production using Stripe test keys to validate everything works:

```bash
# Production deployment with test keys (SAFE)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_current_test_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_current_test_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_test_your_current_webhook_secret
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Test full production deployment safely
- ‚úÖ Validate all payment flows work
- ‚úÖ No risk of real money transactions
- ‚úÖ Easy to debug any issues
- ‚úÖ Can demo to stakeholders safely

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] User can sign up and authenticate
- [ ] Subscription creation works
- [ ] Webhooks are received and processed
- [ ] PDF generation works
- [ ] Email delivery works
- [ ] All Edge Functions respond correctly
- [ ] Database operations work properly

### **Stage 2: Switch to Live Keys (When Ready for Business)**

After validating Stage 1, switch to live keys:

```bash
# Production deployment with live keys (REAL MONEY)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_live_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_live_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_live_your_live_webhook_secret
```

## üîß **Current Recommendation: START WITH TEST KEYS**

Based on your system audit, I recommend **starting with test keys** because:

1. **First Production Deployment**: This appears to be your first production deployment
2. **Complex System**: 87 database tables and advanced infrastructure need validation
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Test keys eliminate financial risk during initial deployment
4. **Debugging**: Easier to troubleshoot issues without real payment concerns

## üìã **Pre-Live Checklist**

Before switching to live Stripe keys, ensure:

### **Business Requirements:**
- [ ] Business legally registered
- [ ] Tax ID number obtained
- [ ] Business bank account set up
- [ ] Stripe account fully verified
- [ ] Terms of service and privacy policy published
- [ ] Refund and cancellation policies defined

### **Technical Requirements:**
- [ ] Production deployment successful with test keys
- [ ] All payment flows tested and working
- [ ] Webhook endpoints updated to production URLs
- [ ] SSL certificates active and valid
- [ ] Error handling and logging implemented
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

### **Compliance Requirements:**
- [ ] PCI compliance considerations addressed
- [ ] Data protection policies implemented
- [ ] Customer data handling procedures defined
- [ ] Dispute handling process established

## üîÑ **Migration Process: Test to Live Keys**

### **Step 1: Prepare Live Environment**

1. **Activate Stripe Account:**
   ```bash
   # Go to Stripe Dashboard
   # Complete account verification
   # Activate live payments
   ```

2. **Get Live Keys:**
   ```bash
   # From Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí API Keys
   # Switch to "Live" mode
   # Copy publishable and secret keys
   ```

3. **Create Live Webhooks:**
   ```bash
   # Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
   # Create new webhook endpoint
   # URL: https://your-production-domain.com/api/webhooks
   # Events: Select all subscription and payment events
   # Copy webhook secret
   ```

### **Step 2: Update Production Environment**

```bash
# Update deployment platform secrets
fly secrets set NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_your_live_key"
fly secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_your_live_key"
fly secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_live_your_live_secret"

# Redeploy application
fly deploy
```

### **Step 3: Validate Live Environment**

```bash
# Test with small amount (if possible)
# Verify webhook delivery
# Check subscription creation
# Validate payment processing
# Test refund process
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations**

### **Test Keys Limitations:**
- No real money processing
- Limited to test card numbers
- Webhooks work but with test data
- Cannot test real bank transfers

### **Live Keys Responsibilities:**
- Real money transactions
- PCI compliance requirements
- Customer data protection
- Dispute and chargeback handling
- Tax reporting obligations

## üéØ **My Recommendation for You**

**Start with Stage 1 (Test Keys)** for your initial production deployment:

1. **Deploy with test keys** to validate the system
2. **Test all functionality** thoroughly
3. **Fix any issues** that arise
4. **Once stable**, prepare for live keys
5. **Switch to live keys** when ready for real business

This approach gives you:
- ‚úÖ Safe production deployment validation
- ‚úÖ Risk-free testing of all systems
- ‚úÖ Confidence before handling real payments
- ‚úÖ Time to address any deployment issues

## üìû **Decision Framework**

**Use Test Keys If:**
- First time deploying to production
- Want to validate deployment pipeline
- Not ready to accept real payments
- Need to demo system safely
- Still debugging or optimizing

**Use Live Keys If:**
- System fully tested and stable
- Business legally ready to operate
- Stripe account fully verified
- Ready to accept real payments
- Have support processes in place

---

**Bottom Line**: Start with test keys for your initial production deployment, then upgrade to live keys when you're ready for real business operations.
