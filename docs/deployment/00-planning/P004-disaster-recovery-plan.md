## Backup & Restoration Procedures

### Database Backup Strategy

#### Automated Backups
```bash
# Daily automated backups (2 AM UTC)
Schedule: 0 2 * * *
Retention: 30 days
Location: Supabase managed backups + S3 cross-region
Encryption: AES-256 at rest
Verification: Automated integrity checks
```

#### Manual Backup Procedures
```bash
# Emergency manual backup
pg_dump -h [host] -U [user] -d [database] --verbose --no-acl --no-owner > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Compressed backup with schema
pg_dump -h [host] -U [user] -d [database] -Fc -v > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump

# Backup verification
pg_restore --list backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump | head -20
```

#### Point-in-Time Recovery
```bash
# Restore to specific timestamp
supabase db restore --project-ref [project-ref] --backup-id [backup-id]

# Verify restoration
psql -h [new-host] -U [user] -d [database] -c "SELECT NOW(), version();"
```

### Application Backup Strategy

#### Code Repository
```bash
# Multiple repository mirrors
Primary: GitHub (github.com/org/quotekit)
Mirror 1: GitLab (gitlab.com/org/quotekit)
Mirror 2: Local Git server (optional)

# Branch protection
- Main branch: Protected, requires reviews
- Production branch: Protected, signed commits
- Release tags: Immutable, signed
```

#### Configuration Backup
```bash
# Environment variables backup (encrypted)
# Store in secure password manager
# Document all production configurations
# Version control infrastructure as code
```

#### Static Assets Backup
```bash
# CDN asset backup
# Periodic download of all static assets
# Store in multiple S3 buckets across regions
# Automated sync verification
```
