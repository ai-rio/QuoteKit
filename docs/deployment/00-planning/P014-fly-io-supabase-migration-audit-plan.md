# Supabase Migration Documentation Audit & MoSCoW Plan

## üìä System Setup Audit Summary

**Audit Date**: August 10, 2025  
**Scope**: Supabase local-to-hosted migration documentation gaps  
**Current State**: **CRITICAL GAP** - Migration process completely undocumented  
**Impact**: **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKING** - Teams cannot deploy to Fly.io without hosted Supabase  

## üîç Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ **What's Currently Documented**
- Environment variables for hosted Supabase (URLs, keys)
- Health check endpoints including Supabase connectivity
- Database recovery commands (`supabase db reset --linked`, `supabase db push --linked`)
- CSP headers with Supabase domains
- Fly.io secrets management for Supabase credentials

### üî¥ **Critical Gaps Identified**
- **No migration process** from local to hosted Supabase
- **No project creation guide** for hosted Supabase setup
- **No data migration strategy** for existing local data
- **No environment transition workflow** from development to staging/production
- **No validation procedures** to ensure successful migration

### üìã **Current Documentation Structure**
```
docs/deployment/fly.io/consolidated-plan/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                     # Mentions "Database Migration" but no details
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ technical-specifications.md   # Has hosted Supabase env vars only
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation-roadmap.md     # Missing migration steps
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ consolidated-moscow-plan.md   # Lists DB migration as "Must Have" but undefined
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POSTHOG_AUDIT_REPORT.md      # PostHog audit (reference for structure)
