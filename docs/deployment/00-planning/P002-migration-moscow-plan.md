## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Schema Migration Failure**: Test on staging first, have rollback plan ready
2. **Environment Configuration Issues**: Validate all variables before deployment
3. **Edge Functions Not Working**: Test each function individually in production
4. **Data Loss During Migration**: Always backup before migration, test restore procedures

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Performance Degradation**: Use existing Sprint 4 monitoring infrastructure
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Leverage existing security hardening system
3. **Monitoring Gaps**: Implement comprehensive alerting from day one

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 100% of migrations applied successfully (28/28)
- [ ] 100% of tables created in production (87/87)
- [ ] 100% of Edge Functions deployed and functional
- [ ] 0 critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] < 500ms average response time
- [ ] > 99.9% uptime

### Business Metrics
- [ ] Successful user registration and authentication
- [ ] Successful quote creation and PDF generation
- [ ] Successful email delivery
- [ ] Successful payment processing
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration

## Resource Requirements

### Total Effort Estimate
- **MUST HAVE**: 9 hours (Critical Path)
- **SHOULD HAVE**: 12 hours (Production Quality)
- **COULD HAVE**: 9 hours (Enhancements)
- **Total**: 30 hours over 3 weeks

### Skills Required
- Supabase administration
- Database migration expertise
- DevOps and deployment experience
- Security configuration knowledge
- Performance monitoring setup

## Conclusion

This MoSCoW plan addresses the critical gap identified in the system audit: **the missing Supabase local-to-hosted migration process documentation**. 

**Priority Focus**: The 9 hours of MUST HAVE items represent the absolute minimum required to address the deployment blocker. These items should be completed first before considering any SHOULD HAVE or COULD HAVE items.

**Success Criteria**: Once all MUST HAVE items are completed, QuoteKit will be ready for production deployment with its comprehensive Sprint 4 infrastructure systems fully operational.

---

**Next Action**: Begin with M1 (Supabase Production Project Setup) as it unblocks all other critical path items.
