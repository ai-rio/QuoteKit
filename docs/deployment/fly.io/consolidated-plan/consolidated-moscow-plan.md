### Mitigation Strategies
1. **PostHog**: Implement with feature flags for gradual rollout
2. **Memory**: Start with 1GB allocation, monitor and adjust
3. **API Performance**: Implement caching and database indexing

## Success Metrics

### Deployment Success
- Zero deployment failures
- All health checks passing
- 100% environment variable configuration
- PostHog analytics functional

### Performance Targets
- API response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Application startup time < 30 seconds
- Memory usage < 80% of allocated
- Zero memory-related crashes

### Operational Targets
- 99.9% uptime during testing period
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR) < 5 minutes
- All monitoring alerts functional
- Backup/restore procedures validated

## Conclusion

This consolidated plan addresses all critical gaps identified in the system alignment analysis and provides a clear path from 85% to 100% production readiness. The MoSCoW prioritization ensures that deployment blockers are resolved first, followed by production readiness improvements and operational enhancements.

The 6-day implementation timeline is realistic and accounts for the complexity of QuoteKit's architecture with 150+ API routes and multiple external integrations. Success depends on proper resource allocation and adherence to the critical path dependencies outlined in the implementation roadmap.
