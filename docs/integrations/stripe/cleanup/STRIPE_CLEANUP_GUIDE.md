# Stripe Integration Cleanup Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the cleanup and optimization of Stripe integration components to improve code quality, maintainability, and user experience.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate Stripe Loading Logic
- Multiple components implementing similar Stripe.js loading patterns
- Inconsistent error handling across components
- Redundant loading states and retry mechanisms

### 2. Component Complexity
- Large components with mixed responsibilities
- Inline Stripe configuration scattered throughout codebase
- Inconsistent naming conventions

### 3. Error Handling Inconsistencies
- Different error message formats
- Varying retry logic implementations
- Inconsistent fallback behaviors

## Cleanup Strategy

### Phase 1: Consolidate Stripe Loading Logic
Create centralized Stripe loading utilities to eliminate duplication.

#### Before (Scattered Implementation)
```typescript
// In multiple components
const [stripe, setStripe] = useState(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  const loadStripe = async () => {
    try {
      const stripeInstance = await getStripe();
      setStripe(stripeInstance);
    } catch (error) {
      // Different error handling in each component
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
  loadStripe();
}, []);
```

#### After (Centralized Hook)
```typescript
// Custom hook: useStripeLoader
export function useStripeLoader(publishableKey?: string) {
  const [state, setState] = useState<StripeLoadState>({
    status: 'loading',
    stripe: null,
    error: null
  });

  // Centralized loading logic with consistent error handling
  // Automatic retry mechanism
  // Proper cleanup and memory management
}
```

### Phase 2: Component Simplification
Break down large components into focused, single-responsibility components.

#### Component Hierarchy Optimization
```
StripeProvider (Context)
├── StripeEnhancedCurrentPlanCard (Main Component)
├── StripeLoadingState (Loading UI)
├── StripeErrorState (Error UI with Retry)
└── StripeFallbackState (Fallback UI)
```

### Phase 3: Standardize Error Handling
Implement consistent error handling patterns across all Stripe components.

#### Error Classification System
```typescript
interface StripeError {
  type: 'network' | 'configuration' | 'api' | 'unknown';
  message: string;
  retryable: boolean;
  userMessage: string;
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Stripe Utilities
**File**: `src/libs/stripe/stripe-loader.ts`
- Centralized Stripe.js loading logic
- Consistent error handling
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Memory management and cleanup

### Step 2: Implement Stripe Context
**File**: `src/contexts/StripeContext.tsx`
- Global Stripe state management
- Provider component for app-wide access
- Consistent loading states

### Step 3: Refactor Components
**Files**: 
- `src/features/account/components/StripeEnhancedCurrentPlanCard.tsx`
- `src/features/account/components/PaymentMethodsManager.tsx`
- `src/features/checkout/components/CheckoutForm.tsx`

### Step 4: Create Shared UI Components
**Files**:
- `src/components/stripe/StripeLoadingState.tsx`
- `src/components/stripe/StripeErrorState.tsx`
- `src/components/stripe/StripeFallbackState.tsx`

## Benefits Expected

### Code Quality
1. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminate repeated Stripe loading logic
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Single-responsibility components
3. **Improved Testability**: Isolated, focused components
4. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Centralized configuration and logic

### User Experience
1. **Consistent Loading States**: Uniform loading indicators
2. **Better Error Messages**: User-friendly error descriptions
3. **Reliable Retry Logic**: Automatic recovery from transient failures
4. **Faster Load Times**: Optimized Stripe.js loading

### Developer Experience
1. **Easier Debugging**: Centralized error logging
2. **Simpler Integration**: Reusable hooks and components
3. **Better Documentation**: Clear usage patterns
4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript support

## Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration
- [ ] Audit all Stripe-related components
- [ ] Document current error handling patterns
- [ ] Identify shared logic opportunities
- [ ] Plan component hierarchy

### During Migration
