#### 2. changePlan Action Limitations

**File**: `src/features/account/actions/subscription-actions.ts`

**Current Behavior**:
- ✅ Updates database subscription record
- ✅ Validates price existence
- ✅ Handles development mode scenarios
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No Stripe payment processing
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No invoice generation
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No proration charging

**Code Evidence**:
```typescript
// Current implementation only updates database
const { data: updatedSubscription, error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('subscriptions')
  .update(subscriptionUpdate)
  .eq('id', enhancedSubscription.id)

// Missing:
// - stripe.subscriptions.update() call
// - Payment method validation
// - Invoice creation
// - Proration calculation
```

#### 3. Missing Integration Points

**Payment Methods Integration**:
- Plan changes should validate user has valid payment method
- Should allow payment method selection for upgrades
- Should handle payment method failures gracefully

**Billing History Integration**:
- Plan changes should create billing history entries
- Should trigger billing history cache invalidation
- Should show immediate feedback in billing history

**Real-time Updates**:
- Plan changes should trigger account page refresh
- Should update current plan display immediately
- Should refresh payment methods if needed

## 🏗️ Required Integration Architecture

    A[User Clicks Change Plan] --> B[PlanChangeDialog Opens]
    B --> C[Validate Payment Methods]
    C --> D{Has Valid Payment Method?}
    D -->|No| E[Show Add Payment Method]
    D -->|Yes| F[Show Plan Options]
    F --> G[User Selects Plan]

    M --> N[Create Billing Record]
    N --> O[Invalidate Caches]
    O --> P[Show Success Message]
    P --> Q[Refresh Account Page]
```

### Required Components Integration

#### 1. Enhanced PlanChangeDialog
```typescript
interface EnhancedPlanChangeDialogProps {
  // Existing props
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  currentPlan: CurrentPlan;
  availablePlans: ProductWithPrices[];
  
  // NEW: Payment integration props
  paymentMethods: PaymentMethod[];
  onPaymentMethodRequired: () => void;
  onBillingHistoryUpdate: () => void;
  
  // Enhanced plan change handler
  onPlanChange: (
    priceId: string, 
    isUpgrade: boolean,
    selectedPaymentMethod?: string
  ) => Promise<void>;
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced changePlan Action
```typescript
export async function changePlan(
  priceId: string, 
  isUpgrade: boolean,
  paymentMethodId?: string
) {
  // 1. Validate payment method
  // 2. Calculate proration with Stripe
  // 3. Process payment if upgrade
  // 4. Update Stripe subscription
  // 5. Update local database
  // 6. Create billing history entry
  // 7. Invalidate caches
  // 8. Return success/error
}
```

#### 3. Integration with Existing Systems
```typescript
// Integration with useBillingHistory hook
const { refetch: refreshBillingHistory } = useBillingHistory();

// Integration with payment methods
const { paymentMethods, refreshPaymentMethods } = usePaymentMethods();

// Cache invalidation events
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('billing-history-updated'));
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('subscription-updated'));
```

- **Technical Debt**: Incomplete feature creates maintenance burden

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Document the Gap**: ✅ This document
2. **Update Sprint Planning**: Add integration stories to backlog
3. **Stakeholder Communication**: Inform stakeholders of current limitations
4. **User Communication**: Consider disabling plan change UI until fixed

## 📋 Sprint Planning Impact

### Current Sprint 1 Status
- **US-P3-001**: 85% complete (blocked by schema issues)
- **US-P3-002**: 100% complete ✅
- **US-P3-003**: 0% complete
- **US-P3-004**: 0% complete

### Recommended Sprint Adjustments

#### Option A: Extend Sprint 1
- Add US-P3-007 (Payment Integration) to Sprint 1
- Extend sprint by 1 week to accommodate critical fix
- Delay Sprint 2 analytics features

#### Option B: Emergency Sprint 1.5

- Duration: 1 week
- Single focus: Make plan changes functional

#### Option C: Reprioritize Sprint 2
- Move analytics features to Sprint 3
- Make Sprint 2 entirely focused on plan change integration
- Ensure complete payment flow before analytics

**Recommendation**: **Option B** - Emergency Sprint 1.5 for immediate fix
