# Formbricks Survey Implementation Fix

## 🎯 Root Cause Identified

The Formbricks surveys are not appearing in the dev server because **the surveys do not exist in the Formbricks Cloud environment**. The code implementation is correct, but no actual surveys have been created in the Formbricks dashboard.

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **What's Working:**
- Dashboard satisfaction survey component exists and is properly implemented
- FormbricksProvider is correctly configured in the app layout
- Environment variables are properly set in .env file
- Survey trigger logic is correctly implemented (30-second delay, user context)
- Formbricks SDK initialization code is working

❌ **What's Missing:**
- **No surveys exist in the Formbricks Cloud environment**
- Environment ID `cme8xkymlkaijvz01unvdxciq` returns 404 (does not exist)
- No trigger events are configured in Formbricks dashboard

## 🔧 Solution Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Formbricks Account
1. Go to [https://app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com)
2. Create a new account or log into existing account
3. Create a new project for QuoteKit
4. Note down the new Environment ID from Settings > General

### Step 2: Update Environment Configuration
Update your `.env` file with the correct Environment ID:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMBRICKS_ENV_ID=your_new_environment_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMBRICKS_API_HOST=https://app.formbricks.com
FORMBRICKS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Create Dashboard Satisfaction Survey

#### Option A: Manual Creation (Recommended)
1. In Formbricks dashboard, click "Create Survey"
2. Choose "App Survey" type
3. Configure the survey:

**Basic Settings:**
- Name: "Dashboard Satisfaction Survey"
- Type: App Survey

**Questions:**
1. **Satisfaction Rating**
   - Type: Rating Scale
   - Question: "How satisfied are you with the QuoteKit dashboard?"
   - Scale: 1-5 (Very Unsatisfied to Very Satisfied)
   - Required: Yes

2. **Ease of Use**
   - Type: Rating Scale  
   - Question: "How easy is it to find what you need on the dashboard?"
   - Scale: 1-5 (Very Difficult to Very Easy)
   - Required: Yes

3. **Feature Discovery** 
   - Type: Multiple Choice (Multiple Selection)
   - Question: "Which features have you discovered and used from the dashboard?"
   - Options: Quick Stats Overview, Recent Activity, Quick Actions Panel, Analytics (Premium), Create New Quote, Item Library Access, Account Settings, None of these
   - Required: No

4. **Improvement Priority**
   - Type: Multiple Choice (Single Selection)
   - Question: "What would improve your dashboard experience the most?"
   - Options: More detailed analytics, Faster loading times, Better mobile experience, More customization options, Clearer navigation, Additional quick actions, Better visual design, Everything is great as is
   - Required: No

5. **Open Feedback**
   - Type: Open Text
   - Question: "Any additional thoughts on improving the dashboard?"
   - Placeholder: "Share any specific suggestions or feedback..."
   - Required: No

**Trigger Settings:**
- Trigger Type: Event-based
- Event Name: `dashboard_satisfaction_survey_show`
- Event Description: "Triggered when user spends 30+ seconds on dashboard"

**Targeting:**
- User Attributes: `subscriptionTier` equals `free` OR `premium`
- Display Frequency: Once per user
- Recontact after: 30 days

4. Save and **Publish** the survey

#### Option B: Script Creation (After Environment Fix)
Once you have a valid environment ID, run:
```bash
node scripts/create-dashboard-survey.js
```

### Step 4: Verify Survey Deployment
1. Run the test script to verify everything is working:
```bash
node scripts/test-formbricks-setup.js
```

2. Check that the survey appears in your Formbricks dashboard
3. Ensure the survey status is "Live" or "In Progress"

### Step 5: Test Survey Triggering
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the dashboard (`/dashboard`)
3. Wait 30 seconds while staying on the page
4. Interact with the dashboard (scroll, click elements)
5. The survey should appear as a modal overlay

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Survey Still Doesn't Appear:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Open Developer Tools > Console
   - Look for Formbricks initialization logs
   - Should see: "🎉 FORMBRICKS IS FULLY OPERATIONAL! 🎉"

2. **Verify Trigger Conditions:**
   - User must be on dashboard for 30+ seconds
   - User must interact with the page (scroll, click)
   - User hasn't seen survey in last 30 days
   - User attributes match targeting criteria

3. **Debug Trigger Events:**
   - Check Network tab for API calls to Formbricks
   - Look for event tracking calls when triggers should fire

4. **Validate Survey Configuration:**
   - Ensure trigger event name matches exactly: `dashboard_satisfaction_survey_show`
   - Verify survey is published and active in Formbricks dashboard
   - Check that user attributes are being set correctly

### Common Issues:

**"Environment not found" error:**
- Environment ID is incorrect or doesn't exist
- Need to create new Formbricks project and update .env

**"SDK initialization failed" error:**
- Check network connectivity to app.formbricks.com
- Verify API key has correct permissions
- Check for CORS or firewall issues

**Survey appears but doesn't submit:**
- Check API key permissions
- Verify environment configuration in Formbricks dashboard

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics

Once surveys are working:

1. **Response Monitoring:**
   - View responses in Formbricks dashboard
   - Export data for analysis
   - Monitor completion rates

2. **Performance Tracking:**
   - Track survey trigger events in app analytics
   - Monitor user engagement on dashboard
   - Analyze response quality and feedback

3. **Iteration:**
   - Adjust trigger conditions based on response rates
   - Update survey questions based on user feedback
   - A/B test different survey approaches

## ✅ Success Criteria

The fix is successful when:
- ✅ Dashboard satisfaction survey appears after 30 seconds on dashboard
- ✅ Survey is functional and can collect responses  
- ✅ No console errors related to Formbricks
- ✅ Survey data flows through the analytics system
- ✅ All trigger conditions work as documented
- ✅ Responses appear in Formbricks dashboard

## 🎉 Next Steps

After fixing the survey deployment:
1. Test all survey trigger conditions
2. Validate response data collection
3. Set up additional surveys for other user journeys
4. Monitor survey performance and iterate as needed

**Note:** The survey component implementation in `/src/features/dashboard/components/dashboard-satisfaction-survey.tsx` is already correctly implemented and doesn't need any changes. The issue is purely on the Formbricks Cloud side where no surveys exist to be triggered.
