# FreeMium Business Model Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for QuoteKit's freemium business model implementation and feature gating system.

## Documentation Structure

### Business Strategy
- `business-model.md` - FreeMium tier definitions and strategy
- `feature-mapping.md` - Complete feature-to-tier mapping
- `revenue-projections.md` - Business case and projections

### Technical Implementation  
- `implementation-plan.md` - Phased development approach
- `architecture.md` - Technical architecture for feature gating
- `api-protection.md` - Server-side feature enforcement
- `usage-tracking.md` - Usage measurement and limits

### Feature Guides
- `feature-enforcement.md` - How to implement feature gating
- `testing-guide.md` - Testing freemium features
- `migration-guide.md` - Migrating from three-tier to two-tier

### Current Status
- `audit-results.md` - Feature implementation audit findings
- `critical-issues.md` - Must-fix items for launch

## Quick Start

1. Read `business-model.md` for tier definitions
2. Review `implementation-plan.md` for development phases  
3. Check `critical-issues.md` for current blockers
4. Follow `feature-enforcement.md` for implementation patterns

## Key Findings

- **Current Implementation**: 0% of features fully implemented
- **Critical Issue**: `useFeatureAccess` hook returns hardcoded free features
- **Priority Fix**: Usage tracking system missing entirely
- **Architecture**: Good foundations exist but need connection to real data

## Next Steps

Phase 1 implementation focuses on:
1. Fixing `useFeatureAccess` hook to use real subscription data
2. Implementing usage tracking system 
3. Enforcing quote limits properly
