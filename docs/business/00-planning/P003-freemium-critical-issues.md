# Critical Issues for FreeMium Launch

## üö® Launch Blockers

### 1. Feature Access Hook Hardcoded
**File**: `src/hooks/useFeatureAccess.ts`  
**Issue**: Returns `FREE_PLAN_FEATURES` hardcoded, making all feature gating non-functional  
**Impact**: ‚ùå **Complete system failure** - no feature differentiation works  
**Priority**: **CRITICAL**

```typescript
// ‚ùå Current broken implementation
const [features] = useState<PlanFeatures>(FREE_PLAN_FEATURES)
const current = 0 // For now, assume 0 usage
```

**Fix Required**:
- Connect to real Supabase subscription data
- Parse Stripe product metadata into features
- Implement proper loading and error states

### 2. Usage Tracking System Missing
**Impact**: ‚ùå **Quote limits cannot be enforced**  
**Priority**: **CRITICAL**

**Missing Components**:
- Database schema for usage tracking
- Usage increment functions
- Monthly reset logic
- Usage fetching in useFeatureAccess hook

**Consequence**: Free users can create unlimited quotes, breaking the business model

### 3. Quote Creation Enforcement Missing
**Files**: 
- `src/features/quotes/components/CreateQuoteButton.tsx`
- `src/features/quotes/components/QuotesManager.tsx`

**Issue**: No usage checking before quote creation  
**Impact**: ‚ùå **Free users bypass 5-quote limit**  
**Priority**: **CRITICAL**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority Issues

### 4. API Endpoint Protection Missing
**Files**:
- `src/app/api/quotes/[id]/pdf/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/quotes/bulk/route.ts` (if exists)

**Issue**: Server-side feature enforcement missing  
**Impact**: Users can bypass client-side restrictions via direct API calls  
**Priority**: **HIGH**

### 5. PDF Watermark System Missing
**File**: `src/libs/pdf/quote-template.tsx`

**Issue**: Free users get clean PDFs without watermarks  
**Impact**: No differentiation between free and pro PDF exports  
**Priority**: **HIGH**

Current PDF template lacks:
- Watermark for free users
- Logo rendering for pro users
- Feature-based conditional rendering

### 6. Custom Branding Not Implemented
**Issue**: `custom_branding` feature exists in admin but not enforced  
**Impact**: Free users could access branding features if UI existed  
**Priority**: **HIGH**

## üü° Medium Priority Issues

### 7. Analytics Data Mocked
**File**: `src/app/(app)/analytics/page.tsx`

**Current State**: Page has proper access control but uses mock data  
**Issue**: Pro users don't get real analytics value  
**Impact**: Reduced upgrade incentive and user satisfaction  
**Priority**: **MEDIUM**

### 8. Bulk Operations Server Protection
**File**: `src/features/quotes/components/BulkActions.tsx`

**Current State**: Client-side gating exists  
**Issue**: No server-side API protection  
**Impact**: Users could bypass via API manipulation  
**Priority**: **MEDIUM**

## üîµ Low Priority Issues

### 9. Email Templates System Missing
**Impact**: Feature promised in pro tier but doesn't exist  
**Priority**: **LOW** (can be added post-launch)

### 10. Team Collaboration Missing
**Impact**: Feature listed but not implemented  
**Priority**: **LOW** (future enhancement)

| Custom Branding | ‚ùå Not Implemented | No logo rendering, no watermark system |
| Analytics | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Access control works, data is mocked |
| Bulk Operations | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Client gating works, no API protection |
| Email Templates | ‚ùå Not Implemented | Feature doesn't exist |

## Impact on Business Launch

### Revenue Impact
- **Lost Revenue**: Free users getting pro features without paying
- **Support Burden**: Confused users encountering non-functional features
- **Brand Damage**: Professional image compromised by broken functionality

### User Experience Impact
- **Confusion**: Admin UI configures features that don't work
- **Frustration**: Inconsistent feature availability
- **Trust Issues**: System appears broken or misleading

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Blockers (3-5 days)
1. Fix `useFeatureAccess` hook to use real data

2. Add logo rendering for pro users
3. Complete API endpoint protection
4. Fix analytics with real data

### Phase 3: Polish (2-3 days)
1. Add comprehensive error handling
2. Implement upgrade prompts
3. Add usage limit warnings
4. Test end-to-end user journeys
