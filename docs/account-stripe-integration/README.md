# Account-Stripe Integration Epic

## Epic Overview

**Epic Title**: Account-Stripe Integration for Full Subscription Management  
**Epic ID**: STRIPE-ACCOUNT-001  
**Status**: Planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-25  
**Team**: Full Stack Development  

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Currently, the QuoteKit application has a disconnected subscription management experience:
- Users can view their subscription status but cannot modify it within the application
- Admin can configure Stripe and manage products/pricing, but lacks customer management tools
- No unified subscription analytics or customer lifecycle management
- Limited self-service capabilities for users

### Business Value
- **Increased Customer Satisfaction**: Users can manage subscriptions without external redirects
- **Reduced Support Overhead**: Self-service subscription management reduces support tickets
- **Improved Revenue Operations**: Complete subscription analytics and customer lifecycle visibility
- **Streamlined Admin Workflows**: Unified customer and subscription management interface
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Seamless integration between user account and billing systems

## Epic Scope

### In Scope
- User-facing subscription management (upgrade/downgrade/cancel)
- Pricing page with admin-configured products
- Enhanced account management with billing history
- Admin customer management interface
- Subscription analytics dashboard integration
- Webhook enhancements for real-time sync
- Payment failure handling workflows

### Out of Scope
- Multi-currency support (future enhancement)
- Usage-based billing (future enhancement)
- Advanced coupon management (basic coupons only)
- Third-party payment processors (Stripe only)

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **User Self-Service Rate**: 80% of subscription changes handled without support intervention
2. **Admin Efficiency**: 50% reduction in time spent on subscription management tasks
3. **Revenue Visibility**: 100% of subscription metrics available in real-time dashboard
4. **Integration Reliability**: 99.9% webhook processing success rate

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can view and modify their subscription plans
- [ ] Users can update payment methods and view billing history
- [ ] Admins can manage customers and handle failed payments
- [ ] Real-time subscription analytics integrated into admin dashboard
- [ ] All subscription events properly synced between Stripe and application database
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Webhook Reliability**: Critical for data consistency
  - *Mitigation*: Implement retry logic and manual sync capabilities

  - *Mitigation*: Follow PCI compliance best practices, use Stripe's secure APIs

### Medium Risk
- **Data Migration**: Existing subscription data sync
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive backup and testing strategy
- **User Experience**: Complex subscription workflows
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive user testing and progressive enhancement

### Low Risk
- **API Rate Limits**: Stripe API usage
  - *Mitigation*: Implement proper caching and rate limiting
