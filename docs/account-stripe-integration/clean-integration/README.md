**Epic ID**: STRIPE-CLEAN-P3  
**Status**: ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED - INTEGRATION FUNCTIONAL**  
**Created**: 2025-08-01  
**Updated**: 2025-08-01

**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Estimated Completion**: 4-6 weeks (2-3 sprints)

## ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Resolution Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Impact**: Plan change functionality is now fully operational

**RESOLVED ISSUES:**

### 🔧 **Issue A: PlanChangeDialog Payment Method Detection**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Problem**: Payment methods weren't being detected/loaded properly in the plan change dialog  
**Solution**: 
- Fixed API response parsing to handle both `data.data` and `data.paymentMethods` formats
- Added proper loading states with "Loading Payment Methods..." indicator
- Enhanced timing to show dialog immediately with loading state instead of waiting
- Improved error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/account/components/EnhancedCurrentPlanCard.tsx`
- `src/features/account/components/PlanChangeDialog.tsx`

### 🔧 **Issue B: Billing Section Not Updating After Plan Upgrade**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Problem**: Billing history section wasn't refreshing after successful plan changes  
**Solution**:
- Enhanced event dispatching with immediate + delayed refresh (2s + 5s delays)
- Added multiple refresh attempts to account for server-side billing record creation
- Improved success messaging to inform users about billing history updates
- Extended success message display time to 5 seconds

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/account/components/EnhancedCurrentPlanCard.tsx`
- `src/features/account/hooks/useBillingHistory.ts` (already had proper event listeners)

### 🔧 **Additional Debug Script Fixes**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Problem**: Debug scripts had various detection and parsing issues  
**Solution**:
- Fixed billing-history API to return proper `success: true` field
- Updated subscription status debug parsing to match actual API structure
- Enhanced authentication session detection to properly identify cookie-based sessions
- Fixed invalid CSS selector syntax in DOM element detection

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/billing-history/route.ts`
- `debug-test-script.js`

### 📊 **Verification Results**
**All systems tested and confirmed working:**
- ✅ Payment Methods API: 2 payment methods detected and properly formatted
- ✅ Plan Change Dialog: Opens immediately, shows loading state, displays payment methods
- ✅ Billing History Refresh: Event system working with automatic updates
- ✅ Authentication: Cookie-based sessions properly detected
- ✅ Debug Tools: All diagnostic scripts functional
