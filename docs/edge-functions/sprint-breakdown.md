# Sprint Breakdown - Edge Functions Cost Optimization (Updated for QuoteKit Reality)

## IMPORTANT: Realistic Sprint Planning Based on Current QuoteKit Analysis

**⚠️ This sprint breakdown has been updated after analyzing the actual QuoteKit codebase complexity.**

### Key Adjustments Made:

1. **Extended Timeline**: 12 weeks (6 sprints) instead of 10 weeks
2. **Reduced Scope**: Focus on highest-impact consolidations first
3. **Integration Complexity**: Account for existing auth, admin, and feature systems
4. **Migration Strategy**: More gradual approach with existing API patterns
5. **Realistic Savings**: 45-60% cost reduction instead of 60-80%

## Revised Epic Sprint Planning

**Epic Duration**: 12 weeks (6 sprints)  
**Team Velocity**: ~15-18 story points per sprint (reduced due to complexity)  
**Total Story Points**: 95 points (revised)
