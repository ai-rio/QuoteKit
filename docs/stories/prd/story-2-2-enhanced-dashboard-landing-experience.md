## Component Implementation

### Required Shadcn/UI Components:

- ✅ `badge` - Status indicators for quotes
- ✅ `progress` - Progress indicators for setup completion
- ✅ `alert` - Welcome messages and tips for new users
- ✅ `button` - Quick action buttons and navigation (already installed)
- ✅ `tabs` - Organize dashboard sections if needed

### Custom Components to Build:
```tsx
// Dashboard overview with quick actions
<Dashboard>
  <DashboardHeader>
    <WelcomeMessage user={user} />
    <QuickActions>
      <ActionCard href="/quotes/new" icon={Plus} color="forest-green">
        Create New Quote
      </ActionCard>
      <ActionCard href="/items" icon={Package} color="equipment-yellow">
        Manage Items
      </ActionCard>
      <ActionCard href="/settings" icon={Settings} color="stone-gray">
        Settings
      </ActionCard>
    </QuickActions>
  </DashboardHeader>
  
  <DashboardContent>
    <RecentQuotes quotes={recentQuotes} />
    <QuickStats stats={userStats} />
    <GettingStarted progress={setupProgress} />
  </DashboardContent>
</Dashboard>
```

### Implementation Pattern:
1. **Data Aggregation**: Fetch user statistics and recent activity
2. **Quick Actions**: Prominent buttons for primary workflows
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show relevant information based on user progress

## Integration Points

**User Data Integration**: Aggregate data from existing Epic 1 features (quotes, items, settings) to provide meaningful dashboard overview.
