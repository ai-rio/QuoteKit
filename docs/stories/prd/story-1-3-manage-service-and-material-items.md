# Story 1.3: Manage Service and Material Items

As a logged-in user,  
I want to create and manage a database of my services and materials,  
so that I can quickly add them to new quotes without re-typing information.  

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A logged-in user can access a dedicated page, "My Items," to manage their services and materials.  
2. The user can add a new item to their database.  
3. The form for adding a new item must include fields for: Item Name (e.g., "Mulch Installation"), Unit (e.g., "cubic yard"), and Cost/Rate per unit.  
4. The system saves the new item to the user's personal database.  
5. The "My Items" page displays a list of all previously saved items.  
6. The user can edit the name, unit, or cost of any existing item in the list.  
7. The user can delete an item from their database.  
8. When using the quote calculator, the user can select from this list of saved items to add them to a quote.
