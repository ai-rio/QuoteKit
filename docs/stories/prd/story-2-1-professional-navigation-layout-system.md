  <SidebarHeader>
    <LawnQuoteLogo />
    <CompanyName>LawnQuote</CompanyName>
  </SidebarHeader>
  
  <SidebarNav>
    <NavItem href="/quotes" icon={FileText} active={pathname === '/quotes'}>

      Item Library
    </NavItem>
    <NavItem href="/settings" icon={Settings} active={pathname === '/settings'}>
      Settings
    </NavItem>
  </SidebarNav>
  
  <SidebarFooter>
    <LogoutButton />
  </SidebarFooter>
</AppSidebar>
```

### Technical Implementation:

**Existing Features**: Ensure all Epic 1 features (settings, items, quotes, PDF generation) work seamlessly with new navigation.

**Mobile Experience**: Provide professional mobile navigation that maintains all functionality on smaller screens.

This story establishes the visual and navigational foundation for all subsequent Epic 2 enhancements, transforming the application's professional appearance and user experience.
