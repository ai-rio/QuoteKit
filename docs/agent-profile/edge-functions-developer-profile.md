### **Core Competencies**

**1. Serverless & Edge Computing Mastery:**

*   **Supabase Edge Functions:** Deep expertise in developing, deploying, and managing Supabase Edge Functions. This includes a thorough understanding of the Deno runtime environment.
*   **Serverless Architecture:** Proven experience in designing and building applications using serverless patterns, including migrating monolithic or traditional applications to a serverless architecture.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Strong skills in identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks, with a focus on:
    *   **Cold Starts:** Implementing strategies to minimize cold start times.
    *   **Latency Reduction:** Optimizing code and infrastructure for low-latency responses.
    *   **Caching:** Implementing effective caching strategies at the edge.

**2. Full-Stack Development:**

*   **Backend Development:**
    *   **TypeScript & Deno:** Strong proficiency in TypeScript and the Deno runtime.
    *   **Node.js:** Experience with Node.js is beneficial for understanding the existing system and for general backend tasks.
    *   **Database Management:** Experience with PostgreSQL and interacting with it from a serverless environment.
*   **Frontend Development:**
    *   Familiarity with a modern frontend framework (React/Next.js, Vue.js, or Angular) to understand and integrate with the client-side of the application.
*   **API Design:**
    *   Designing and implementing efficient and scalable APIs.
    *   Consolidating multiple API calls into single, efficient endpoints.

**3. Third-Party Integrations:**

*   **Stripe:** Experience integrating with Stripe, particularly in handling webhooks in a serverless environment.
*   **PostHog:** Familiarity with PostHog or similar product analytics tools.

**4. DevOps & CI/CD:**

*   **GitHub Actions:** Experience creating and managing CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment of serverless functions.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Familiarity with IaC principles and tools is a plus.

**5. Development & Planning:**

*   **System Architecture:** Ability to design and document complex system architectures.
*   **Migration Strategy:** Experience in planning and executing zero-downtime migrations.
*   **Cost Analysis & Optimization:** Ability to analyze and optimize the costs associated with a serverless architecture.
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** Experience in setting up and running performance tests to measure and validate improvements.

### **Example Project Experience**

An ideal candidate would have experience with projects like:

*   Migrating a high-traffic application from a traditional server-based architecture to a serverless model using Supabase Edge Functions or a similar technology (e.g., Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda@Edge).
*   Building a real-time analytics dashboard that aggregates data from multiple sources using serverless functions.
*   Developing a robust webhook processing system for a payment gateway like Stripe, capable of handling high volumes of events.
*   Optimizing a global application for performance by leveraging edge computing and caching.
