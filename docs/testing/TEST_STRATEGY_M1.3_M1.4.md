# Test Strategy for M1.3 and M1.4: Client and Property Management

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the implementation of tasks M1.3 and M1.4, which involve extending the `ClientForm` component and creating a new `PropertyManager` component. The goal is to ensure the new features are robust, reliable, and meet the requirements defined in the sprint plan.

## 2. Scope

The scope of this test strategy includes the following features:

- **M1.3: Extend `ClientForm.tsx`**
  - Integration of the `PropertyManager` component.
  - Conditional rendering of the `PropertyManager` for existing clients.
- **M1.4: Create `PropertyManager.tsx`**
  - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for properties.
  - Address validation and formatting.
  - Bulk property import functionality (placeholder).

## 3. Testing Types

### 3.1. Unit Testing

Unit tests will be written to verify the functionality of individual components in isolation.

- **`ClientForm.tsx`:**
  - Test that the `PropertyManager` component is rendered only when editing an existing client.
- **`PropertyManager.tsx`:**
  - Test the address validation logic.
  - Test the state management of the component.

### 3.2. Integration Testing

Integration tests will be performed to ensure that the `ClientForm` and `PropertyManager` components work together as expected.

- **`ClientForm.tsx` and `PropertyManager.tsx`:**
  - Test that properties can be added, edited, and deleted for a client.
  - Test that the `PropertyManager` is correctly initialized with the client's properties.

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E tests will be conducted to simulate real user scenarios and verify the complete workflow.

- **Client and Property Management Workflow:**
  - Create a new client.
  - Edit the client and add multiple properties.
  - Edit and delete properties.
  - Verify that the changes are persisted correctly.

### 3.4. Manual Testing

Manual testing will be performed to cover scenarios that are difficult to automate and to ensure the user experience is optimal.

- **UI/UX Testing:**
  - Verify that the UI is intuitive and easy to use.
  - Check for any visual glitches or inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Testing:**
  - Test the application with unexpected inputs and scenarios to identify any potential issues.

## 4. Test Cases

### 4.1. `ClientForm.tsx`

| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TC-CF-001 | Verify that the `PropertyManager` is not visible when creating a new client. | The `PropertyManager` component should not be rendered. |
| TC-CF-002 | Verify that the `PropertyManager` is visible when editing an existing client. | The `PropertyManager` component should be rendered with the client's properties. |

### 4.2. `PropertyManager.tsx`

| Test Case ID | Description | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TC-PM-001 | Add a new property with valid data. | The new property should be added to the list. |
| TC-PM-002 | Edit an existing property with valid data. | The property should be updated in the list. |
| TC-PM-003 | Delete a property. | The property should be removed from the list. |
| TC-PM-004 | Attempt to add a property with an invalid address. | An error message should be displayed, and the property should not be added. |
| TC-PM-005 | Click the "Bulk Import" button. | An alert or placeholder message should be displayed. |
