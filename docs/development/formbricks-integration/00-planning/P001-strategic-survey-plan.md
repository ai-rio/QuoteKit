# Strategic Formbricks Survey Implementation Plan
## QuoteKit - Non-Overwhelming User Feedback Strategy

### Executive Summary
Based on the current Formbricks implementation audit, this document outlines a strategic approach to create targeted surveys that gather valuable user insights without overwhelming users. The plan focuses on key user journey moments and follows UX research best practices.

### Current Implementation Status
✅ **Formbricks SDK**: Fully integrated with comprehensive event tracking (30+ events)
✅ **Dashboard Satisfaction Survey**: Already implemented with 30-second trigger
✅ **Event Tracking**: Advanced tracking system for quotes, features, and user interactions
✅ **User Context**: Automatic user attribute synchronization with Supabase auth

### Strategic Survey Objectives

#### Primary Goals
1. **Improve User Onboarding** - Identify friction points in first-time user experience
2. **Optimize Quote Creation Flow** - Understand abandonment points and workflow issues
3. **Feature Discovery & Adoption** - Learn which features users find valuable
4. **Retention Insights** - Understand why users stay or leave
5. **Product-Market Fit** - Measure satisfaction and identify improvement priorities

#### Success Metrics
- Survey completion rate: >15% (industry benchmark: 10-12%)
- User satisfaction score: >4.0/5.0
- Feature adoption increase: >20% after implementing feedback
- User retention improvement: >10% month-over-month

### Survey Strategy Framework

#### 1. Timing-Based Approach (Non-Overwhelming)
```
User Journey Stage → Survey Trigger → Max Frequency
├── Onboarding (Day 1) → After first quote creation → Once
├── Early Usage (Day 7) → After 3rd quote → Once  
├── Regular Usage (Day 30) → Monthly satisfaction → Monthly
├── Feature Discovery → After new feature use → Once per feature
└── Churn Risk → Before subscription cancellation → Once
```

#### 2. Survey Length Guidelines
- **Micro-surveys**: 1-2 questions (completion rate: 20-30%)
- **Short surveys**: 3-5 questions (completion rate: 15-20%)
- **Standard surveys**: 6-10 questions (completion rate: 8-12%)
- **Never exceed**: 10 questions for any survey

#### 3. User Segmentation Strategy
```
Segment → Survey Focus → Trigger Conditions
├── New Users (0-5 quotes) → Onboarding experience → First quote completion
├── Growing Users (6-20 quotes) → Feature discovery → Weekly usage patterns
├── Power Users (21+ quotes) → Advanced features → Monthly engagement
├── Premium Users → Premium feature value → Subscription events
└── At-Risk Users → Retention factors → Inactivity patterns
```

}
```

### Implementation Guidelines

#### 1. Survey Frequency Management
```javascript
// Global survey frequency rules
const SURVEY_FREQUENCY_RULES = {
  maxSurveysPerWeek: 1,
  minTimeBetweenSurveys: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 7 days
  maxSurveysPerMonth: 3,
  respectUserOptOut: true,
  pauseAfterNegativeFeedback: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 30 days
};
```

#### 2. User Experience Optimization
- **Mobile-first design**: All surveys optimized for mobile devices
- **Progress indicators**: Show completion progress for surveys >2 questions
- **Skip options**: Always allow users to skip optional questions
- **Thank you messages**: Acknowledge participation and explain how feedback is used
- **Incentives**: Consider small incentives for longer surveys (premium trial, feature previews)

#### 3. Data Collection & Analysis
```javascript
// Survey response analysis framework
const ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK = {
  quantitativeMetrics: [
    'completion_rate',
    'average_rating',
    'nps_score',
    'feature_adoption_rate'
  ],
  qualitativeAnalysis: [
    'sentiment_analysis',
    'theme_extraction',
    'pain_point_identification',
    'feature_request_categorization'
  ],
  segmentationAnalysis: [
    'by_user_tier',
    'by_usage_level',
    'by_subscription_type',
    'by_business_size'
  ]
};
```

#### 4. Response & Action Plan
- **Weekly review**: Analyze survey responses every Friday
- **Monthly reporting**: Compile insights for product team
- **Quarterly roadmap**: Incorporate feedback into product planning
- **User communication**: Share how feedback influenced product decisions

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Survey Creation Scripts
Create programmatic survey creation using Formbricks Management API:

```javascript
// scripts/create-strategic-surveys.js
const surveys = [
  FIRST_QUOTE_COMPLETION_SURVEY,
  FEATURE_DISCOVERY_SURVEY,
  QUOTE_ABANDONMENT_SURVEY,
  PREMIUM_VALUE_SURVEY,
  MONTHLY_SATISFACTION_SURVEY
];

async function createAllSurveys() {
  for (const survey of surveys) {
    await createSurvey(survey);
    console.log(`Created survey: ${survey.id}`);
  }
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Tracking Integration
Update existing tracking to support new survey triggers:

```javascript
// Enhanced event tracking for survey triggers
export const SURVEY_TRIGGER_EVENTS = {
  FIRST_QUOTE_COMPLETED: 'first_quote_completed',
  WEEK_ONE_MILESTONE: 'week_one_milestone', 
  QUOTE_ABANDONED_24H: 'quote_abandoned_24h',
  PREMIUM_30_DAY_MILESTONE: 'premium_30_day_milestone',
  MONTHLY_ACTIVE_CHECK: 'monthly_active_check'
};
```

#### 3. Survey Response Handling
Implement response processing and follow-up actions:

```javascript
// Survey response processor
export class SurveyResponseProcessor {
  async processResponse(surveyId: string, response: any) {
    // Analyze sentiment
    const sentiment = await analyzeSentiment(response);
    
    // Trigger follow-up actions
    if (sentiment.score < 3) {
      await triggerSupportOutreach(response.userId);
    }
    
    // Update user attributes
    await updateUserAttributes(response.userId, {
      lastSurveyCompleted: new Date(),
      satisfactionScore: sentiment.score
    });
  }
}
```

### Success Monitoring

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Survey Engagement**
   - Completion rate by survey type
   - Time to complete
   - User opt-out rate

2. **Product Insights**
   - Feature adoption rate changes
   - User satisfaction trends
   - NPS score progression

3. **Business Impact**
   - User retention correlation with survey participation
   - Feature request → development → satisfaction cycle
   - Premium conversion rate improvements

#### Dashboard Metrics
Create a survey analytics dashboard to track:
- Real-time completion rates
- Response sentiment analysis
- Feature request prioritization
- User satisfaction trends
- Survey fatigue indicators

### Risk Mitigation

#### Preventing Survey Fatigue
1. **Frequency caps**: Never exceed 1 survey per week per user
2. **Relevance targeting**: Only show surveys relevant to user's current journey stage
3. **Opt-out respect**: Honor user preferences and provide easy opt-out
4. **Value communication**: Always explain how feedback improves their experience

#### Quality Assurance
1. **A/B testing**: Test survey variations for optimal completion rates
2. **Mobile testing**: Ensure all surveys work perfectly on mobile devices
3. **Load testing**: Verify surveys don't impact app performance
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure surveys meet WCAG guidelines

### Next Steps

#### Week 1-2: Foundation
1. Create survey creation scripts
2. Set up survey response processing
3. Implement enhanced event tracking
4. Create first two surveys (First Quote + Feature Discovery)

#### Week 3-4: Expansion  
1. Deploy Quote Abandonment survey
2. Create Premium Value Assessment survey
3. Set up analytics dashboard
4. Begin response analysis workflow

#### Week 5-6: Optimization
1. Deploy Monthly Satisfaction survey
2. Analyze initial survey performance
3. Optimize based on completion rates
4. Plan Phase 2 advanced surveys

#### Ongoing: Iteration
1. Weekly response analysis
2. Monthly survey performance review
3. Quarterly strategy adjustment
4. Continuous user experience optimization

This strategic approach ensures we gather valuable user insights while maintaining a positive user experience and avoiding survey fatigue.
