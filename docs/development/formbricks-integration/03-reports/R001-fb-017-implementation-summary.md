### Technical Implementation

#### API Integration
- ✅ Corrected authentication method from Bearer token to X-API-Key header
- ✅ Fixed survey definition format to match Formbricks API requirements
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling and response parsing
- ✅ Created reusable API utility functions

#### Survey Structure
- ✅ Multi-language format with `{default: "text"}` structure
- ✅ Proper question type mapping (multipleChoiceSingle, multipleChoiceMulti, nps, rating, openText)
- ✅ Welcome cards with appropriate messaging
- ✅ Display options configured for multiple showings
- ✅ 30-day recontact period set

#### Scripts Created
1. **`create-fb017-surveys.js`** - Initial survey creation script
2. **`fb017-survey-definitions.js`** - Survey definition templates
3. **`manage-surveys.js`** - Comprehensive survey management
4. **`publish-surveys.js`** - Survey publishing automation
5. **`survey-status.js`** - Status monitoring and reporting

### Key Learnings

#### API Corrections Made
1. **Authentication**: Changed from `Authorization: Bearer` to `X-API-Key` header
2. **Survey Format**: Updated to use multi-language structure with default keys
3. **Publishing Method**: Used PUT method to update survey status to 'inProgress'
4. **Response Structure**: Handled nested `data` object in API responses

#### Survey Configuration
- App surveys don't require pre-created action triggers
- Surveys can be displayed multiple times with recontact day limits
- Segment filters are automatically created for each survey
- Status progression: draft → inProgress (published)

### Current Status
- ✅ All 3 FB-017 surveys are published and active
- ✅ Surveys are ready for data collection
- ✅ Management scripts are in place for ongoing maintenance
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging implemented

### Next Steps

#### Integration with QuoteKit
1. Configure survey triggers in the application
2. Set up user segmentation logic
3. Implement survey display conditions
4. Test survey functionality in development

#### Monitoring and Analytics
1. Set up response monitoring dashboard
2. Configure automated reporting
3. Implement response analysis workflows
4. Set up alert systems for low response rates

#### Maintenance
1. Regular survey performance reviews
2. Question optimization based on response data
3. Segment refinement as user base grows
4. Survey lifecycle management
