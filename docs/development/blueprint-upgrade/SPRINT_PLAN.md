## ðŸ“‹ Daily Standup Template

### Daily Questions:
1. **What did you complete yesterday toward Blueprint implementation?**
2. **What will you work on today?**
3. **Are there any blockers preventing MoSCoW deliverables?**
4. **Do you need help leveraging existing infrastructure patterns?**

- [ ] Database migrations execute cleanly
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] New components follow style guide compliance
- [ ] Assessment workflow completion rate >90%
- [ ] Quote creation time remains <2 minutes

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Guidelines

### **Leverage Existing Patterns**

#### **Database Migrations** (Follow existing pattern):
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDD_description.sql
-- Use existing RLS policy patterns
-- Follow established naming conventions
-- Include proper indexes and constraints
```

#### **Component Extensions** (Follow COMPLETE_STYLE_GUIDE_COMPLIANCE.md):
```tsx
// Extend existing components rather than recreate
// Apply forest-green headings and charcoal text patterns
// Use established card styling: rounded-2xl, shadow-lg
// Follow button styling patterns from style guide
```

#### **Server Actions** (Follow existing patterns):
```typescript
// Use established error handling patterns
// Follow existing validation approaches
// Leverage current Stripe integration patterns
// Maintain existing security measures
```

### **Quality Gates**

#### **Definition of Done** for each task:
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- [ ] Component styling matches COMPLETE_STYLE_GUIDE_COMPLIANCE.md
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or warnings
- [ ] Existing functionality remains unaffected
- [ ] Mobile responsive design verified
- [ ] Manual testing completed on staging
- [ ] Code review approved by team lead

#### **Sprint Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 100% of MUST HAVE items completed
- [ ] 80% of SHOULD HAVE items completed  
- [ ] Zero regression bugs in existing features
- [ ] Assessment workflow functional end-to-end
- [ ] Property management system operational
- [ ] B2B2C payment workflow basic functionality

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Risk Mitigation

### **High Risk Items**:
1. **Database Migration Complexity**
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing on staging environment
   - **Rollback**: Prepared rollback scripts for each migration

2. **Existing Quote Functionality**
   - **Mitigation**: Extend components rather than replace
   - **Testing**: Regression testing on existing quote workflows

3. **Stripe Integration Changes**
   - **Mitigation**: Leverage existing infrastructure, minimal changes
   - **Testing**: Payment workflow verification on staging

### **Contingency Plans**:
- If Week 1 foundation delayed: Focus on core client/property separation only
- If assessment system complex: Implement basic version, enhance in future sprint
- If B2B2C integration challenging: Defer to next sprint, focus on core Blueprint needs
