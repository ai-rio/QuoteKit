# Invoice Download Implementation Fix

## Issue Description
The billing history table shows download buttons for invoices, but clicking them doesn't work properly because:
1. No dedicated API route exists for invoice downloads
2. The component tries to open invoice URLs directly, but many are placeholder values (`#`)
3. No proper error handling for missing or invalid invoice URLs

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing API Route
The `BillingHistoryTable` component expected an API route at `/api/billing-history/[id]/invoice` but this route didn't exist.

### 2. Invalid Invoice URLs
Many billing records have `invoice_url: '#'` as a placeholder, making downloads impossible.

### 3. No Stripe Integration
The download functionality wasn't properly integrated with Stripe's invoice system.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Invoice Download API Route
**File**: `src/app/api/billing-history/[id]/invoice/route.ts`

**Features**:
- ✅ Authenticates user and verifies ownership
- ✅ Fetches invoice from Stripe using invoice ID
- ✅ Supports both redirect and proxy download methods
- ✅ Handles Stripe-hosted invoices and PDF URLs
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Security checks to prevent unauthorized access

**Usage**:
```
GET /api/billing-history/{invoice_id}/invoice
GET /api/billing-history/{invoice_id}/invoice?type=proxy
GET /api/billing-history/{invoice_id}/invoice?download=true
```

### 2. Enhanced BillingHistoryTable Component
**File**: `src/features/account/components/BillingHistoryTable.tsx`

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Uses new API route for Stripe invoices (IDs starting with `in_`)
- ✅ Falls back to direct URLs for non-Stripe invoices
- ✅ Disables download buttons for invalid/missing invoices
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Improved button states and tooltips

### 3. Debug Script for Testing
**File**: `debug-invoice-download.js`

**Features**:
- ✅ Tests billing history API
- ✅ Checks for invoice download API route
- ✅ Analyzes DOM download buttons
- ✅ Tests invoice URL accessibility
- ✅ Provides detailed diagnostics and recommendations

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Run the Debug Script
```javascript
// Copy and paste debug-invoice-download.js into browser console
// It will automatically run comprehensive tests
```

### 2. Manual Testing Steps
1. Go to `/account` page
2. Check billing history section
3. Look for download buttons (should be enabled/disabled appropriately)
4. Click a download button for a valid invoice
5. Verify it opens/downloads the invoice correctly

### 3. API Testing
```bash
# Test the API route directly
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/billing-history/in_test123/invoice" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Valid Invoices (Stripe IDs starting with 'in_')
- Download button is enabled
- Clicking opens invoice in new tab via API route
- API route redirects to Stripe's hosted invoice URL
- User can view/download the PDF

### ✅ Invalid/Missing Invoices
- Download button is disabled
- Button shows "Unavailable" text on mobile
- Tooltip indicates "Invoice not available"
- No error when clicking (button is disabled)

### ✅ Error Handling
- Network errors fall back to direct URL if available
- Clear error messages for authentication issues
- Proper HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, 500)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## File Changes Summary

### New Files
- `src/app/api/billing-history/[id]/invoice/route.ts` - Invoice download API
- `debug-invoice-download.js` - Debug script for testing
- `debug-invoice-download-fix.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `src/features/account/components/BillingHistoryTable.tsx` - Enhanced download handling

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Debug script runs without errors
- [ ] API route responds correctly for valid invoice IDs
- [ ] Download buttons show proper enabled/disabled states
- [ ] Valid invoices download/open correctly
- [ ] Invalid invoices show appropriate disabled state
- [ ] Error handling works for network issues
- [ ] Mobile and desktop views both work
- [ ] Authentication is properly enforced
- [ ] Logging provides useful debugging information

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Toast Notifications**: Add user-friendly notifications for download status
2. **Progress Indicators**: Show loading state during download
3. **Bulk Download**: Allow downloading multiple invoices at once
4. **Invoice Preview**: Show invoice preview before download
5. **Download History**: Track which invoices have been downloaded

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Caching**: Cache invoice metadata to reduce Stripe API calls
2. **Compression**: Compress proxied PDFs for faster downloads
3. **CDN**: Use CDN for frequently accessed invoices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **404 on API route**: Ensure the route file is in the correct location
2. **Authentication errors**: Check user session and Stripe customer setup
3. **Stripe API errors**: Verify Stripe keys and invoice ID format
4. **CORS issues**: Use the proxy method instead of direct redirects

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Test specific invoice
debugTestInvoiceDownload('in_test123', 'https://invoice-url');

// Click download button programmatically
debugClickDownloadButton(0);

// Run full diagnostic
debugInvoiceDownload();
```
