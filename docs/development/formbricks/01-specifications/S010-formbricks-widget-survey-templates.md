## API Deployment Instructions

### Using Formbricks Management API

To deploy these surveys, use the existing API infrastructure:

1. **Create surveys via POST requests to Formbricks Management API**
2. **Each survey should be triggered by its respective event**
3. **The events are already configured in the widget:**
   - `feedback_feature_request`
   - `feedback_bug_report` 
   - `feedback_appreciation`

### Test the Integration

After creating the surveys in Formbricks:

1. Test each widget option triggers the correct survey
2. Verify survey responses are collected properly
3. Check analytics dashboard shows survey performance
4. Confirm the updated LawnQuote branding appears correctly

## Notes

- All surveys are configured for single display to avoid spam
- Questions are designed to be completed in 2-4 minutes
- Response data will be available via `/api/formbricks/responses`
- Survey performance can be monitored at `/analytics/surveys`
