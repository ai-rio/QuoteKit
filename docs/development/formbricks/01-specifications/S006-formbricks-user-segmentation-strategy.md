# FB-017: User Segmentation Strategy for QuoteKit Formbricks Integration

**Sprint 5 - Story Points: 3**  
**Status**: Design Phase Complete  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-17

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive user segmentation strategy for QuoteKit's Formbricks integration. The strategy leverages existing user context data and analytics to create meaningful user segments that enable targeted surveys with higher completion rates and more actionable insights.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Improved Survey Relevance**: 25-40% higher completion rates through targeted surveys
- **Actionable Insights**: Segment-specific feedback drives targeted product improvements
- **Reduced Survey Fatigue**: Users receive fewer, more relevant surveys
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Segment analytics inform feature prioritization

## User Segmentation Framework

### 1. Primary Segmentation Dimensions

Based on analysis of existing user context tracking in `/src/components/tracking/user-context-tracker.tsx`, we identify five key segmentation dimensions:

#### A. Subscription Tier Segmentation
```typescript
enum SubscriptionTier {
  FREE = 'free',
  PRO = 'pro', 
  ENTERPRISE = 'enterprise',
  TRIAL = 'trial'
}
```

#### B. Usage Pattern Segmentation
```typescript
enum UsagePattern {
  NEW_USER = 'new_user',        // < 10 quotes created
  LIGHT_USER = 'light_user',    // 10-25 quotes created
  REGULAR_USER = 'regular_user', // 26-50 quotes created
  POWER_USER = 'power_user',    // 50+ quotes created
  DORMANT_USER = 'dormant_user' // No activity in 30+ days
}
```

#### C. Business Value Segmentation
```typescript
enum BusinessValue {
  STARTER = 'starter',         // < $5,000 total revenue
  GROWING = 'growing',         // $5,000 - $25,000 total revenue
  ESTABLISHED = 'established', // $25,000 - $100,000 total revenue
  ENTERPRISE = 'enterprise'    // $100,000+ total revenue
}
```

#### D. Complexity Preference Segmentation
```typescript
enum ComplexityPreference {
  SIMPLE = 'simple',           // Primarily simple quotes
  MIXED = 'mixed',             // Variety of quote types
  COMPLEX = 'complex'          // Primarily complex quotes
}
```

#### E. Feature Adoption Segmentation
```typescript
enum FeatureAdoption {
  BASIC = 'basic',             // Core features only
  INTERMEDIATE = 'intermediate', // 3-5 features used
  ADVANCED = 'advanced'        // 5+ features used regularly
}
```

### 2. Segment Definitions

### 3. Automatic Segmentation Rules

#### 3.1 Real-Time Segmentation Logic

```typescript
interface SegmentationRules {
  primarySegment: {
    subscriptionTier: SubscriptionTier;
    usagePattern: UsagePattern;
    businessValue: BusinessValue;
  };
  behavioralSegments: {
    complexityPreference: ComplexityPreference;
    featureAdoption: FeatureAdoption;
    devicePreference: 'desktop' | 'mobile' | 'mixed';
  };
  contextualSegments: {
    industry?: string;
    teamSize?: 'solo' | 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
    geography?: string;
  };
}
```

#### 3.2 Segmentation Algorithm

**Step 1: Calculate Usage Metrics**
```typescript
const calculateUsagePattern = (user: UserContext): UsagePattern => {
  const { quotesCreated, daysActive, lastActiveDate } = user;
  
  // Check for dormancy first
  const daysSinceActive = daysBetween(lastActiveDate, new Date());
  if (daysSinceActive > 30) return UsagePattern.DORMANT_USER;
  
  // Classify by quote volume
  if (quotesCreated < 10) return UsagePattern.NEW_USER;
  if (quotesCreated < 26) return UsagePattern.LIGHT_USER;
  if (quotesCreated < 50) return UsagePattern.REGULAR_USER;
  return UsagePattern.POWER_USER;
};
```

**Step 2: Determine Business Value**
```typescript
const calculateBusinessValue = (user: UserContext): BusinessValue => {
  const { totalRevenue } = user;
  
  if (totalRevenue < 5000) return BusinessValue.STARTER;
  if (totalRevenue < 25000) return BusinessValue.GROWING;
  if (totalRevenue < 100000) return BusinessValue.ESTABLISHED;
  return BusinessValue.ENTERPRISE;
};
```

**Step 3: Analyze Complexity Preference**
```typescript
const calculateComplexityPreference = (user: UserContext): ComplexityPreference => {
  // Based on existing complexity detection in FB-011
  const complexQuoteRatio = user.complexQuotes / user.totalQuotes;
  
  if (complexQuoteRatio > 0.7) return ComplexityPreference.COMPLEX;
  if (complexQuoteRatio > 0.3) return ComplexityPreference.MIXED;
  return ComplexityPreference.SIMPLE;
};
```

### 4. Segment-Specific Survey Strategies

#### 4.1 New User Surveys

**New Free User Survey**
- Trigger: After 3rd dashboard visit OR 7 days after signup

  2. "What's your biggest challenge with creating quotes?" (Open text)
  3. "Which feature would help you most?" (Priority ranking)
  4. "How likely are you to recommend QuoteKit?" (NPS)
- Completion Target: 35%

**New Trial User Survey**
- Trigger: Day 7 of trial OR after 5th quote creation

  1. "How has QuoteKit impacted your business?" (Open text)
  2. "Which workflows take too long?" (Multiple choice)
  3. "What features are missing?" (Open text)
  4. "Rate your satisfaction with quote creation speed" (Scale 1-5)
- Completion Target: 30%

**Power Enterprise User Survey**
- Trigger: Quarterly for power users

  3. "What template features are missing?" (Open text)
  4. "Rate template management experience" (Scale 1-5)
- Completion Target: 50%

### 5. Targeting Logic Implementation

#### 5.1 Survey Eligibility Rules

```typescript
interface SurveyTargeting {
  segments: string[];
  conditions: {
    minQuotes?: number;
    maxQuotes?: number;
    subscriptionTiers?: SubscriptionTier[];
    daysSinceLastSurvey?: number;
    hasFeatureUsage?: string[];
  };
  exclusions: {
    recentSurveyParticipant?: boolean;
    churned?: boolean;
    supportTicketActive?: boolean;
  };
}
```

#### 5.2 Survey Frequency Rules

**Frequency Caps by Segment:**
- New Users: Max 1 survey per 2 weeks
- Regular Users: Max 1 survey per month  
- Power Users: Max 1 survey per 3 weeks
- Dormant Users: Max 1 reactivation survey per quarter

#### 5.3 Smart Timing Logic

```typescript
const calculateOptimalSurveyTime = (user: UserContext): Date => {
  const { timezone, lastActiveHour, usagePattern } = user;
  
  // Based on user's typical active hours
  const preferredHour = lastActiveHour || 14; // Default 2 PM
  
  // Adjust for user pattern
  const delayDays = usagePattern === 'power_user' ? 1 : 3;
  
  return addBusinessDays(new Date(), delayDays)
    .setHour(preferredHour);
};
```
