## Alternative: JavaScript/Fetch Approach

If you prefer to use JavaScript instead of curl:

### Feature Request Survey
```javascript
const featureRequestSurvey = {
  name: "Feature Request Feedback",
  type: "web",
  status: "inProgress",
  // ... (same payload as curl above)
};

const response = await fetch('/api/formbricks/surveys', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(featureRequestSurvey)
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log('Survey created:', result);
```

## Verification Steps

After creating the surveys:

1. **Check if surveys were created:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/formbricks/surveys
```

2. **Test the feedback widget:**
   - Click each feedback option in the widget
   - Verify the correct survey appears
   - Complete a test survey

3. **Check survey responses:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/formbricks/responses
```

4. **Monitor analytics:**
   - Visit `/analytics/surveys` 
   - Check survey performance metrics

## Notes

- All surveys are configured to trigger on their respective events (`feedback_feature_request`, `feedback_bug_report`, `feedback_appreciation`)
- Surveys are set to `displayOnce` to prevent spam
- Each survey has contextual questions designed for 3-4 minute completion time
- Thank you cards reinforce the LawnQuote branding
- Surveys collect actionable feedback for product improvement
