- **Personalized**: Surveys tailored to user tier, usage patterns, and history

### Key Integration Points

1. **Dashboard Analytics**
   - Usage pattern feedback
   - Feature discovery surveys
   - NPS for power users

2. **Quote Creation Flow**
   - Workflow friction identification
   - Feature request collection
   - Complexity feedback

3. **Subscription Management**
   - Upgrade hesitation surveys
   - Churn prevention feedback
   - Feature value assessment

4. **Onboarding Experience**
   - First-time user experience
   - Setup completion feedback
   - Initial value realization

## Technical Overview

### Architecture Pattern
- **Client-Side Integration**: Formbricks JS SDK embedded in QuoteKit
- **Event-Driven**: Surveys triggered by user actions and behaviors
- **Context-Aware**: Rich user and session data for personalization
- **Privacy-Compliant**: Respects user preferences and data protection

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Formbricks JS SDK (@formbricks/js)
- **Backend**: Formbricks Cloud or self-hosted instance
- **Database**: Integration with QuoteKit's existing PostgreSQL
- **Analytics**: Custom dashboard for feedback insights

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Formbricks Cloud (Recommended for MVP)
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Setup Time**: 1-2 days
- **Maintenance**: Minimal
- **Cost**: Subscription-based
- **Scalability**: Managed

#### Option 2: Self-Hosted Docker
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Setup Time**: 3-5 days
- **Maintenance**: Moderate
- **Cost**: Infrastructure only
- **Scalability**: Manual

#### Option 3: Kubernetes Cluster
- **Complexity**: High
- **Setup Time**: 2-3 weeks
- **Maintenance**: High
- **Cost**: Infrastructure + DevOps
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling

## User Experience Design

### Survey Principles
1. **Contextual Relevance**: Right survey, right time, right user
2. **Minimal Friction**: Quick, focused questions
3. **Value Exchange**: Clear benefit to user for participation
4. **Respectful Timing**: Non-disruptive to core workflows
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, get detailed over time

### Survey Types

#### Micro-Surveys (1-2 questions)
- Post-action feedback (quote created, feature used)
- Quick satisfaction ratings
- Feature discovery prompts

#### Standard Surveys (3-5 questions)
- Feature-specific feedback
- Workflow improvement surveys
- Upgrade decision factors

#### Comprehensive Surveys (5+ questions)
- Quarterly NPS surveys
- Annual product satisfaction
- Detailed feature requests

## Data Strategy

### Data Collection
- **Behavioral Data**: User actions, feature usage, session patterns
- **Contextual Data**: Subscription tier, company size, industry
- **Feedback Data**: Survey responses, ratings, open-ended feedback
- **Performance Data**: Survey completion rates, response quality

### Data Privacy
- **Consent Management**: Clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary information
- **Anonymization**: Option for anonymous feedback
- **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations

### Data Usage
- **Product Development**: Feature prioritization and improvement
- **User Experience**: Workflow optimization and pain point resolution
- **Business Intelligence**: Conversion optimization and churn prevention
- **Customer Success**: Proactive support and engagement

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Additional JavaScript load and API calls
- **Integration Complexity**: Potential conflicts with existing code
- **Data Synchronization**: Keeping user context in sync
- **Third-Party Dependency**: Reliance on Formbricks service availability

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of load times
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phased deployment with feature flags
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation if service unavailable
- **Regular Testing**: Automated tests for integration points

### Business Risks
- **Survey Fatigue**: Over-surveying users leading to decreased participation
- **Privacy Concerns**: User discomfort with data collection
- **Resource Allocation**: Development time away from core features
- **Data Overload**: Too much feedback data to process effectively

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Smart Targeting**: Intelligent survey frequency and targeting
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about data usage
- **Prioritized Development**: Focus on high-impact integrations first
- **Automated Analysis**: Tools for processing and categorizing feedback
