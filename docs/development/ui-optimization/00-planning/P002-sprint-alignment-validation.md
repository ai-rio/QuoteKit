- Bridge uses simplified inline pricing preview instead

**Code Evidence**:
```typescript
// AssessmentCompletionBridge.tsx - Missing integration:
// ‚ùå No import: import { PricingExplanationPanel } from './PricingExplanationPanel';
// ‚ùå No usage in bridge modal
// Instead uses basic pricing preview (lines 205-230)
```

**Business Impact**:
- Phase 1 Week 2 objective **"Users understand pricing rationale in <30 seconds"** completely unmet
- Advanced pricing explanation exists but users never see it
- Customer trust-building opportunity missed
- Professional positioning opportunity lost
