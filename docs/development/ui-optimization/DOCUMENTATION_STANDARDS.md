# Project Documentation Standards

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for systematic documentation organization across all QuoteKit initiatives
**Scope**: Project-wide standard for all feature development, implementation, and reporting documentation

---

## 🌐 Project-Wide Application

This documentation standard applies to **ALL QuoteKit development initiatives**, not just UI optimization. Every new project, feature, or significant development effort should follow this systematic approach.

### **Universal Initiative Types**
- **UI/UX Projects**: `docs/development/ui-optimization/`, `docs/development/mobile-interface/`
- **Backend Systems**: `docs/development/payment-system/`, `docs/development/assessment-engine/`
- **API Development**: `docs/development/api-v2/`, `docs/development/webhook-system/`
- **Infrastructure**: `docs/development/deployment-automation/`, `docs/development/monitoring/`
- **Integrations**: `docs/development/stripe-integration/`, `docs/development/third-party-apis/`
- **Testing Initiatives**: `docs/development/testing-automation/`, `docs/development/performance-testing/`

### **Benefits of Standardization**
- **Team Efficiency**: Any developer can navigate any initiative documentation instantly
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Consistent structure reduces onboarding time for new team members  
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic DRAFT process prevents premature completion claims
- **Scalability**: Standard supports unlimited concurrent initiatives without confusion
- **Maintenance**: Consistent patterns make documentation updates straightforward

## 🏷️ Naming Convention

### **File Naming Pattern**: `[Category][Number]-[Status]-[descriptive-name].md`

#### **Category Prefixes**
- **P**: Planning (strategic analysis, investigations, validations)
- **S**: Specifications (technical requirements, user journeys, APIs)  
- **I**: Implementation (roadmaps, guides, procedures)
- **R**: Reports (status updates, completion summaries, metrics)

#### **Numbering System**
- **Format**: Zero-padded 3-digit numbers (`001`, `002`, `010`, `100`)
- **Sequence**: Chronological creation order within each category
- **Gaps**: Acceptable (allows for logical insertion)

#### **Status Indicators** (Required for Implementation & Reports)
- **DRAFT-**: Work-in-progress, not user-approved or tested
- **None**: Approved and validated content (Planning & Specifications)

#### **Descriptive Names**
- **Format**: Lowercase with hyphens (`user-journey-specifications`)
- **Length**: 2-6 words maximum
- **Clarity**: Immediately recognizable purpose

### **Examples**
```
✅ CORRECT:
- P001-investigation-findings.md
- S001-user-journey-specifications.md  
- I001-DRAFT-roadmap-execution.md
- R001-DRAFT-phase1-completion-report.md

❌ INCORRECT:
- investigation_findings.md
- UserJourneySpecs.md
- FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- Phase1Complete.md
```

---

## 📋 Content Guidelines

### **README.md: Navigation Index Only**
- **Purpose**: Directory navigation and quick reference
- **Content**: File listings, purpose summaries, cross-references
- **Restrictions**: NO detailed implementation content
- **Updates**: Required when files are added/moved/renamed

### **Planning Documents (P###)**
- **Status**: Final upon creation (no DRAFT prefix)
- **Purpose**: Strategic analysis, investigations, business cases
- **Content**: Findings, validations, opportunity analysis
- **Approval**: Not required (informational/analytical)

### **Specifications Documents (S###)**  
- **Status**: Final upon creation (no DRAFT prefix)
- **Purpose**: Technical requirements, user flows, API definitions
- **Content**: Detailed specifications for implementation
- **Approval**: Not required (technical documentation)

### **Implementation Documents (I###-DRAFT-)**
- **Status**: DRAFT until user approval and testing
- **Purpose**: Execution guides, roadmaps, procedures
- **Content**: Step-by-step implementation instructions
- **Approval**: Required before removing DRAFT prefix

### **Report Documents (R###-DRAFT-)**
- **Status**: DRAFT until validation and user approval  
- **Purpose**: Status updates, completion reports, metrics
- **Content**: Progress tracking, outcomes, recommendations
- **Approval**: Required before removing DRAFT prefix

## 🔄 Migration Process

### **Step 1: File Assessment**
1. Read existing file content and purpose
2. Determine appropriate category (P/S/I/R)
3. Assign sequential number within category
4. Create descriptive name following conventions

### **Step 2: Content Migration**
1. Move file to appropriate folder with new naming
2. Update internal cross-references to new paths
3. Verify content formatting and completeness
4. Add DRAFT prefix if implementation/report category

### **Step 3: Index Updates**
1. Update README.md navigation links
2. Update cross-references in other documentation
3. Verify all file paths are accessible
4. Test navigation flow for completeness

### **Migration Template for Any Initiative**

## 🧪 Testing Scripts & Artifacts Organization

### **CRITICAL: No Testing Scripts in Project Root**
**MANDATORY RULE**: All testing scripts, validation files, and testing artifacts MUST be organized within the documentation structure or appropriate project directories. **NEVER create testing files in project root.**

### **Testing Script Placement Guidelines**

#### **Testing Documentation** (Follow Four-Category System)
```
docs/development/[initiative]/
├── 00-planning/
│   └── P###-testing-strategy.md              # Test planning and strategy
├── 01-specifications/  
│   └── S###-test-requirements.md             # Test specifications and scenarios
├── 02-implementation/
│   └── I###-DRAFT-testing-implementation.md  # Test execution guides
└── 03-reports/
    └── R###-DRAFT-testing-results.md         # Test results and validation reports
```

#### **Executable Testing Scripts** (Organized in Project Structure)
```
scripts/testing/[initiative]/                  # Initiative-specific test scripts
├── unit-tests/
├── integration-tests/
├── performance-tests/
└── validation-scripts/

tests/[initiative]/                            # Initiative-specific test suites  
├── unit/
├── integration/
├── e2e/
└── performance/

docs/development/[initiative]/testing-assets/  # Test data, fixtures, configurations
├── test-data/
├── fixtures/
├── configurations/
└── mock-data/
```

### **Testing Script Naming Convention**

#### **Documentation Files**
- **Planning**: `P001-testing-strategy.md`, `P002-test-case-analysis.md`
- **Specifications**: `S001-test-requirements.md`, `S002-validation-criteria.md`  
- **Implementation**: `I001-DRAFT-test-execution-guide.md`, `I002-DRAFT-automation-setup.md`
- **Reports**: `R001-DRAFT-test-results.md`, `R002-DRAFT-validation-report.md`

#### **Executable Scripts**
```
scripts/testing/[initiative]/
├── test-[feature]-unit.js
├── test-[feature]-integration.js
├── validate-[feature]-performance.js
└── setup-[feature]-testing.js

tests/[initiative]/
├── [feature].test.ts
├── [feature].integration.test.ts
├── [feature].e2e.test.ts
└── [feature].performance.test.ts
```

### **Prohibited Testing Practices**
```
❌ NEVER CREATE IN ROOT:
- test-results.md
- validation-report.md  
- testing-summary.md
- performance-analysis.md
- test-[anything].js/ts in root
- validation-[anything].js/ts in root

❌ NEVER CREATE WITHOUT INITIATIVE CONTEXT:
- generic-test-script.js
- random-validation.md
- standalone-test-results.md
```

### **Required Testing Practices**
```
✅ ALWAYS ORGANIZE BY INITIATIVE:
docs/development/payment-system/00-planning/P001-testing-strategy.md
docs/development/ui-optimization/03-reports/R001-DRAFT-test-results.md
scripts/testing/assessment-engine/test-assessment-validation.js
tests/mobile-interface/mobile-responsiveness.test.ts

✅ ALWAYS USE DRAFT PREFIX FOR RESULTS:
- R001-DRAFT-testing-results.md (until validated)
- R002-DRAFT-performance-validation.md (until approved)
- I001-DRAFT-testing-implementation.md (until tested)
```

### **Testing Initiative Examples**

├── 00-planning/P001-test-automation-strategy.md
├── 01-specifications/S001-ci-cd-requirements.md  
├── 02-implementation/I001-DRAFT-automation-setup.md
