## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Prerequisites Before Phase 1**

**Current Reality Check** (January 2025): Phase 1 claimed complete but has **critical blockers** preventing real-world testing.

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Fix Critical Blockers**
**Timeline**: 3-5 days | **Impact**: Enables any meaningful testing or validation

1. **üö® CRITICAL**: [Assessment Creation Workflow](./00-planning/P001-investigation-findings.md#critical-implementation-blockers-real-world-testing) - Users cannot create assessments (0% workflow success)
2. **üö® CRITICAL**: [Navigation Discovery](./01-specifications/S001-user-journey-specifications.md#assessment-creation-workflow-fixes-critical-prerequisites) - Missing "New Assessment" sidebar option  
3. **üîß HIGH**: [Pricing Panel Integration](./00-planning/P002-sprint-alignment-validation.md#phase-1-implementation-status--gaps) - PricingExplanationPanel exists but unused

### **Phase 1 Completion Requirements**: 
Before any Phase 2 work, complete [Critical Fixes](./02-implementation/I001-DRAFT-roadmap-execution.md#-phase-1-completion-requirements-critical-fixes) documented in roadmap.

### **üìã Documentation Organization**
This initiative follows the [Documentation Standards](./DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md) for systematic organization:
- **00-planning/**: Strategic analysis and investigation findings
- **01-specifications/**: Technical requirements and user journey specs  
- **02-implementation/**: Execution guides (DRAFT until tested and approved)
- **03-reports/**: Status and completion reports (DRAFT until validated)
