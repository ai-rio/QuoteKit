# **Foundational Line Item Database for LawnQuote Software**

This document provides a comprehensive and structured database of services and materials common to the landscaping and lawn care industry. It is designed to serve as the foundational dataset for the LawnQuote Software application. The hierarchical structure is intentionally organized to mirror the typical workflow of a landscaping professional, from initial client consultation and design to the specific labor activities and material selections required for project execution. This logical flow ensures that the end software will be intuitive for its target usersâ€”solo operators and small businesses. A core principle reflected throughout this database is the necessity for flexibility in units of measure; a single service may be quoted in multiple ways depending on the job's context, and a versatile quoting tool must accommodate this reality.1

## **I. Services Database**

This section outlines all billable labor, activities, and professional services. The categories progress from high-level planning and recurring maintenance to the granular tasks that constitute larger installation and construction projects.

### **Consultation & Design Services**

The initial phase of many landscaping projects involves planning, assessment, and design. These services represent the intellectual property of the contractor and are often billed at a premium compared to physical labor.

The pricing structure for design services reflects the maturity and capabilities of a landscaping business. A new operator might only offer an initial consultation, while a growing firm can add 2D and 3D design plans as flat-fee services to help sell larger installation jobs. Established design-build firms often use a percentage-of-project model (typically 10% to 20%) for comprehensive projects where design and installation are fully integrated.3 The software should allow the user to select the most appropriate billing method for these distinct service levels.

| Initial Site Consultation | Flat Fee or Hourly | $100 \- $300 | Often credited towards project cost if hired.3 |
