## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Integration Points

**Dashboard Page Integration:**
```tsx
<DashboardSatisfactionSurvey
  userTier={user.user_metadata?.subscriptionTier || 'free'}
  isPremium={isPremium}
  stats={dashboardData.stats}
/>
```

**Event Tracking:**
```typescript
trackEvent(FORMBRICKS_EVENTS.DASHBOARD_SATISFACTION_SURVEY_TRIGGERED, {
  userTier,
  isPremium,
  experienceLevel: getDashboardExperienceLevel(),
  timeBeforeTrigger: 30,
  hasQuotes: stats.totalQuotes > 0,
  hasRevenue: stats.totalRevenue > 0,
  quotesCount: stats.totalQuotes,
  revenue: stats.totalRevenue,
  triggerContext: 'dashboard_30_second_engagement',
  surveyVersion: 'v1.0'
});
```

**User Attributes:**
```typescript
setUserAttributes({
  subscriptionTier: userTier,
  isPremiumUser: isPremium,
  hasCreatedQuotes: stats.totalQuotes > 0,
  hasGeneratedRevenue: stats.totalRevenue > 0,
  dashboardExperienceLevel: getDashboardExperienceLevel(),
  lastDashboardVisit: new Date().toISOString(),
  timeSpentOnDashboard: timeOnDashboard
});
```
